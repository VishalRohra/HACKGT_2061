They don\u2019t want to hear it.       \u2026I would say very simply I just want to be treated like everybody else. You see, I was always the fair hair boy. I was a big contributor. Nobody knows the system. But I was on the other side. And I was the elite. I was the fair hair person. Once I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider. I became an outsider because I was running. Because I wasn\u2019t supposed to run. I\u2019m this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman. But I\u2019m not supposed to be running for office. The fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade. And I\u2019m not knocking those countries. Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders. They are absolutely killing us. China \u2013 taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base. And think of this: We owe China $1.4 trillion and we\u2019re paying them interest. We owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount \u2013 $1.4 trillion. Now, that\u2019s like a magic act. They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. That\u2019s not going to happen with me.         \u2026Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man. I\u2019ll be honest. I think he\u2019s a very nice person. I think he\u2019s a very low energy person and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the country needs. I hear he\u2019s going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me. And honestly, look, he\u2019s getting the money from special interests. He\u2019s getting the money from lobbyists and his donors. And they\u2019re making him do it because he\u2019s crashing in the polls. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I know that my life will continue. I just don\u2019t know. I mean nobody\u2019s ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I\u2019ve done. You know, one of the things I\u2019m most honored about is that so far everybody that\u2019s attacked me has gone down the tubes. You have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he\u2019s at zero. You have Perry attacked me. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at zero. Everybody \u2013 Rand Paul attacked me. I see the last poll \u2013 the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I\u2019m leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me. Now, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big. So I don\u2019t know. Are they going to spend \u2013 he\u2019s going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money. Remember this \u2013 they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money. Nobody knows the system better than me. They have total control. You understand it very well because you\u2019ve been covering it for a long time. Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate. I will tell you this: Nobody\u2019s putting up millions of dollars for me. I\u2019m putting up my own money. In fact, I feel a little bit foolish. People are offering me millions and millions of dollars. You know, when you\u2019re in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down.

I have very good relationships with the people of New Hampshire. But I\u2019ve had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.       I really don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t see that happening. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. You don\u2019t \u2013 nobody does. We\u2019ll see what \u2013 you\u2019ll have many, many people that aren\u2019t doing very well. I am doing very well. But you have many, many people that are here, that are well-known politicians \u2013 they\u2019re governors and they\u2019re senators \u2013 but they\u2019re not doing very well. And they just came back from a, you know, very major defeat yesterday. And mine wasn\u2019t. ...You know, it\u2019s very interesting. If you look at the numbers from yesterday, I got the highest number in history outside the one number \u2013 in the history of the primary.       ...Also, I guess they had 185,000 people, which is 45,000 or 50,000 people more than they ever had.       No, I mean, I think we\u2019ll get a lot of Sanders\u2019s voters. You know, they\u2019re very much into the trade world and I\u2019m the best on trade. He mentions it but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be capable of doing anything about it. No, I think we\u2019re going to do really well here. I look forward to it.       We have a lot of events scheduled, yes.       Well, we do. We have one commitment long-term for Arkansas actually where we\u2019re going to have about 10,000 people. But we\u2019re going to be back and forth very quickly. We\u2019re going to have a lot of events scheduled, yes.       Well, I just think, you know, I\u2019m just happy with the way we\u2019re doing. You know, we\u2019ve bonded with the people whether it\u2019s there or here. I mean, there\u2019s just a big bonding process going on. If you look at South Carolina, it\u2019s the same thing. I mean, we\u2019re doing really well there. But we\u2019ve devoted much more time here and South Carolina \u2013       It\u2019s not a question of learning. I mean, I just want to continue to do well...Our theme \u2013 the theme is so important. It\u2019s just make America great again. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Not really a question of learning.   Well, if you look at the second place, people didn\u2019t talk about my second place. They didn\u2019t talk about it as positively as they should have. And yet, with Marco who was more than 2,000 votes behind me \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of votes by the way \u2013 they said, \"Oh, he\u2019s surging. He\u2019s surging.\" So, I don\u2019t know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run \u2013 Scott was mentioning before \u2013 \"One of the amazing things about you, you\u2019ve never run for office before. It\u2019s incredible how you did.\"       My brand\u2019s doing great. Yeah.       No, I think just work. We\u2019re going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings, a lot of talks, a lot of speeches. We\u2019re going to be meeting with a lot of people and I think we\u2019re going to do very well.       Well, we\u2019ll be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight, I think they have 4,000 or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people. Same venue, same everything. They had 200 people. So we have \u2013 there\u2019s a good bonding going on.       Well, I enjoyed it.       I have unlimited, I have unlimited \u2013 you know, it\u2019s funny. When I look at the various people, they said so and so has $20 million. I have unlimited. That\u2019s not the thing. The only \u2013 you know, I\u2019m a businessperson. I want to spend wisely. And I\u2019m probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly I haven\u2019t had to spend very much although I guess we just did a recent filing and I would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million. But I\u2019m self-funding. And I must tell you, I don\u2019t know that enough people appreciate it. I\u2019m self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not. So I won\u2019t be influenced by the lobbies and you know et cetera, et cetera. But I don\u2019t know \u2013 I was talking to Scott about this before \u2013 I don\u2019t know it\u2019s really appreciated by the voters. I\u2019m the only one on both sides that\u2019s self funding. I\u2019m putting up my own money. And I don\u2019t know that the voters appreciate it. When they go into vote, I don\u2019t think they say \"I\u2019m going to vote for Trump because he\u2019s self-funding and he\u2019s not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera.\"       I\u2019m going to tell them and I tell them. But sometimes they like it but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something they vote for, which is a shame because it\u2019s actually a very big thing. You understand that. It\u2019s a very big thing. It\u2019s a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisions...or looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent. That\u2019s a real positive... I just don\u2019t know whether or not the voters appreciate it.       I\u2019ve learned that they\u2019re great people. I really, I thought the people in Iowa were fantastic...You know, obviously I was second. I had the largest vote getting in the history of a Republican primary except for one and I brought many of those extra people in. And they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of Republican primaries in terms of Iowa by far \u2013 not even close. I think it was like 50,000 or 60,000 more than they\u2019ve ever had before. So I just \u2013 I learned that they are terrific people in Iowa.   Yeah, I look forward to it.       ...No, I don\u2019t think so. I have a very good relationship with Marco. I like him... I don\u2019t see that necessarily.

I don\u2019t really think \u2013 look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally. I was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13. I ended up coming in second. Didn\u2019t devote tremendous time to it. Didn\u2019t devote tremendous money to it. In fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, I\u2019m about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient. I came in second. I came into strong second. Third, I think, was quite a bit away \u2013 I think 2,500 or something \u2013 close to 3,000 votes away. There\u2019s a big difference between second and third. I think we did really well. You know, as far as that\u2019s concerned. I think the press \u2013 some of the press said I did fantastically well. Some of the press doesn\u2019t want to give it credit. I think we did very well. I didn\u2019t expect to do so well. I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said I\u2019m 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people. But it had taken me back to June 16th. I was told \"Don\u2019t even go to Iowa. Start right here in New Hampshire. Just don\u2019t waste your \u2013 \" ...I\u2019m going to Iowa. I went. I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals. We did really fantastically and came very close to winning. I mean, we came very close to winning. We came in second place. So I am very happy with what happened in Iowa. You know, you had 17 people and I was second. Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second. And I think we did a very good job.   No, I don\u2019t think I feel any pressure.

On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and businesses. Likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country. On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of American workers. Whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, we\u2019re going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\u2019re babies.

And it\u2019s going to be very interesting to see what happens. But as you know, they\u2019re playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so I think it will be very exciting. It\u2019ll add to the excitement in Cleveland and that\u2019s good. That\u2019s what we want because it\u2019s going to be an exciting period of time. We have \u2013 we\u2019ve done some awfully good work.

So that\u2019s a great. You know, when you think Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far. So that\u2019s something to me that\u2019s very exciting.

I\u2019m very proud to say that we\u2019ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that\u2019s also a record. So we\u2019ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters. Our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know. We\u2019re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of Hillary.

Rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure.   Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.   I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.   You know, we\u2019re building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we\u2019re converting it into one of the world\u2019s great hotels. It\u2019s gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after \u2014 or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.   Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we\u2019re really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I\u2019ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.   So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.   You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.   Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.       Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that\u2019s being lost.   Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.   Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we\u2019re in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what\u2019s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.   Be careful of a bubble because what you\u2019ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.   And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.   SPEECH 7     Chris, thank you very much. I appreciate it. This has been an amazing evening. Already, we\u2019ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine.   It\u2019s really been \u2014 it\u2019s really been great. I want to congratulation Ted on the winning of Texas. He worked hard on he \u2014 I know how hard he worked actually, and so I congratulate Ted Cruz on that win. That was an excellent win.

I mean, if she hasn\u2019t straightened it out by now, she\u2019s not going to straighten it out in the next four years. It\u2019s just going to become worse and worse. She wants to make America whole again and I\u2019m trying to figure out what is that all about. Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again. So I just want to say that this was an exciting evening. It\u2019s so great to be in Florida. It\u2019s so great to be at Mar-A-Lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.

THEY ARE DROWNING PEOPLE IN STEEL CAGES, BY THE DOZENS, AT A TIME. AND SHE SAYS, WE DON'T LIKE HIS TONE. LET ME TELL YOU, FOLKS, IT IS TIME FOR A TOUGH TONE. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THINGS THE SMART WAY. I REMEMBER DURING THE DEBATE THEY ASKED ONE OF THE FOLKS ON THE DEBUT STAGE WHO IS BECOMING FRIENDLIER AND FRIENDLIER BY THE DAY WITH ME, WHICH SOME OF THE PEOPLE ARE RECOVERING. IT WAS -- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. THEY SAY IT WAS THE NASTIEST PRIMARY THAT ANYBODY HAS SEEN. THEY SAY THE NASTIEST IN RECORDED HISTORY. WHO KNEW WHAT WENT ON BEFORE RECORDED. BUT IT WAS PRETTY NASTY. AND SOME OF THE FOLKS, I SAW ONE YESTERDAY, I WILL NOT EVEN MENTION NAMES BECAUSE I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY, RIGHT. I WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH THEM. EXCEPT FOR THE REAL ENEMY. BUT THEY'LL SIGN A DOCUMENT, ALL RIGHT, IT IS CALLED A PLEDGE. I PLEDGE -- I PLEDGE, I SWEAR, I PLEDGE THAT IF I DON'T MAKE IT, I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE NOMINEE OF THE PARTY. IT DOESN'T SAY, SUBJECT TO CHANGE, SUBJECT TO THE WEATHER, SUBJECT TO THE SUN DOESN'T COME UP. NO. IT SAID, I PLEDGE. AND FOR THAT PLEDGE, THEY GOT ACCESS TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MATERIAL FROM THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE, THE RNC. REINCE PRIEBUS, DOING A GREAT JOB. AND IF HE DOESN'T, I'LL TELL YOU. AND IF HE DOESN'T OVER THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS, I'LL TELL YOU. BUT THEY GOT ACCESS. SO THEY SIGNED A PLEDGE THEY WILL SUPPORT. I DON'T WANT THEIR SUPPORT. IT WON'T MEAN ONE VOTE THAN PERHAPS THEIR FAMILY. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. BUT I SIGNED THE PLEDGE, TOO. AND EVERYBODY WANTED TO SIGN THE PLEDGE. AND THE REASON THEY SIGNED THE PLEDGE WAS TO GET ME TO SIGN IT. I SIGNED IT. I WOULD HAVE HONORED IT. I SAID PEOPLE SHOULD HONOR PLEDGES. PEOPLE SHOULD HONOR DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY SIGN THEM. YOU KNOW, NOT A BIG DEAL. NOT A BIG DEAL. BUT THEY SHOULD HONOR THEM. SO HERE IS THE STORY, FOLKS. WE'RE LOSING OUR COUNTRY. WE'RE LIKE A PIECE OF SWISS CHEESE AT THE BORDERS. THAT IS GOING TO END. THAT'S GOING TO END. YOU KNOW, THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS, 16,500, FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THEY'VE DONE THIS, THEY'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, 16,500 BORDER PATROL AGENTS HAVE ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP. THEY KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY WHAT IS GOING ON AT THE BORDER.

THAT IS AN EASY JOB. THEY CAN'T STAND IT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT IS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY. THEY WANT TO DO THEIR JOB. WITH ME, THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING REALLY HARD. AND I SAID TO THEM, WHEN THEY CALLED ME TO TELL ME ABOUT THE ENDORSEMENT, NEVER DONE IT BEFORE, THEY'VE NEVER ENDORSED A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BEFORE, 16,500, GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE AND I SAID TO THEM, SO LET ME TELL YOU, I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION -- HOW IMPORTANT IS THE WALL": {"in_response_to": [{"text": "YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO ROUGH.

We\u2019ve created this. We have stupid leadership. Really stupid leadership. So when I started, I said we have to do something about it. It\u2019s not something I wanted to do.

They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they\u2019re representing. And these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they\u2019re told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors. Me, I\u2019m going to do the right thing.

It\u2019s going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be easy. So, I started and I talked about the border. Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration. Took a lot of heat. But you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about that subject if I didn\u2019t bring it up. And I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about. But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed. And by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way. We\u2019re going to protect the Second Amendment. We\u2019re going to protect the guns. We\u2019re going to protect your guns. You know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married. She came on a fiancee permit...You know, wonderful fiancee. She was totally radicalized. Maybe radicalized him. Maybe he was already that way. But we\u2019ve got to start thinking. We have to start using our head. Bad stuff is happening. We have to find out what\u2019s going on. We have a president who won\u2019t even talk about the term. If you think, he won\u2019t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on. And you can\u2019t solve the problem if you don\u2019t talk about it. You have to talk about it. So, very, very strongly we started talking about that. And then after Paris \u2013 and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world. You can\u2019t have a gun unless you\u2019re bad guy, you bought a gun. And they walked in just said \"Boom! Boom! Boom! You, move over. Boom!\" Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded. But if we had a couple of \u2013 few of the people that I pointed out \u2013 I could plenty in this audience, believe me. But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks. It\u2019d be a whole different story.   So very, very big on the Second Amendment. But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more. I went up 11 points. I don\u2019t want to do it for that reason. But it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great. I love John Wayne. From Iowa. But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who\u2019s an incredible woman, and she said, \"We\u2019d like to endorse you.\" John Wayne was a strong guy.

They didn\u2019t know what it was for. And again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying. I have received letters \u2013 heartfelt letters. ...The bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore. Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think I\u2019ll go over $6 million pretty easily. Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building. But nobody talks about that. So we raised $5.6 million. We have so many happy groups. So many happy veterans. And then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside. Now, of course, they don\u2019t know the extent. They probably figured based on reading the press that Trump didn\u2019t make, you know, didn\u2019t raise this kind of money. But we raised a lot and I\u2019ll be raising more and we\u2019ll be sending it to other people as we get along.       It\u2019s a complicated process.       No, it doesn\u2019t...You know, the government sort of approves different groups for a lot of reasons. So it really does \u2013 and more than anything else, it\u2019s also speaking to other veterans. We have a circle of veterans. I don\u2019t want to send a $250,000 check to a group that doesn\u2019t do good work. So it\u2019s called vetting. We vet the vets. But it\u2019s called vetting.       I think it\u2019s bothersome because I love the vets and I\u2019ve worked hard for the vets. And as you can see, I\u2019ve given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets. And I think when the press portrays it differently, the press is being very dishonest. So I don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like dishonesty.       Jeff Sessions is a fantastic man. Jeff Sessions is one of the most highly respected people in the United States Senate. Jeff Sessions is a person that I believe that Ted Cruz has the most respect for and I think Ted thought that he would get an endorsement. You know, Jeff Sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as he\u2019s been in the Senate. So you know, Jeff Sessions is certainly somebody that I would consider. Absolutely. He\u2019s a fantastic person.       I think it was a very tough call. It was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla the way he held that child that almost like a mother holding a baby \u2013 looks so beautiful and calm. And there were moments where it looked pretty dangerous. I don\u2019t think they had a choice. I mean, probably they didn\u2019t have a choice. You have a child, a young child, at stake. You know, it\u2019s too bad there wasn\u2019t another way. I thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 pound gorilla and the way he dealt with that little boy. But it just takes one second. It\u2019s one second \u2013 it\u2019s not like it takes place over \u2013 well, he\u2019s going to do it 30 seconds from now. It just takes one little flick of his finger. And I will tell you they probably had no choice. ...     I\u2019m entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care. VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country what\u2019s going on. You look at what\u2019s happening in Phoenix and different places throughout the country where they\u2019re catching people stealing and they don\u2019t even fire them, where people are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They\u2019re dying while they wait on line. And I am in favor of if they can\u2019t get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they\u2019re going to see a doctor and the country\u2019s going to pay for it. They\u2019re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately. We\u2019re losing thousands of people waiting on line. And the Veterans Administration is run by Obama just as incompetently as he\u2019s running our country. You look at the TSA, you look at what\u2019s going on at the airports and you look at that.

You weren\u2019t allowed to have any more. You weren\u2019t allowed to have any more people than that.

That\u2019s Donald Trump. I met him over a year ago. I\u2019ve been involved in many fundraisers. There are many scammers out there. He did the right thing by vetting these groups there.

It\u2019s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on. And you know, I have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, we\u2019ll just say all over the country. And it\u2019s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly. Recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation. I mean, our nation is in serious trouble. We\u2019re being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed. China is just taking advantage of us. I have nothing against China. I have great respect for China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders. Our leaders don\u2019t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much. No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit. It won\u2019t be that way for long. We have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we\u2019re going to redo those trade deals and it\u2019s going to be a thing of beauty. You look at countries like Mexico, where they\u2019re killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border. They\u2019re destroying us in terms of economic development. Companies like Carrier Air Conditioner just moving into Mexico. Ford, moving into Mexico. Nabisco, closing up shop in Chicago and moving into Mexico. We have to stop it, folks. I know how to stop it. We\u2019re going to create jobs. We\u2019re going to create jobs like you\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019re going to lower taxes. I have a plan that Larry Kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class. The middle class has been forgotten in our country. It really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we\u2019re all so proud of, but we\u2019ve forgotten the middle class. So we\u2019re going to lower taxes. We\u2019re lowering taxes on business. You look at all the companies that are moving out. When you see Pfizer moving to Ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they\u2019re leaving. They used to move from New York to Florida, or they\u2019d move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris. But now they\u2019re moving from here \u2014  \u2014 not that many people are leaving New Jersey. But Chris understands the problem, fully understands. Now they\u2019re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world. We can\u2019t let that happen. We\u2019ve lost our manufacturing jobs. We\u2019ve lost our manufacturing. Millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses. I mean, we are losing so much. We can\u2019t let it happen. I tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders Caterpillar. And recently, he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because they\u2019ve cut the yen. They\u2019ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete. And I don\u2019t want that to happen. That\u2019s not going to happen. They shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do it. We have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source. We have great, great power. The problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. So we\u2019re going to work very, very hard. I\u2019m so honored by this evening. If you would\u2019ve told me on June 16th, when I was with my wife, Melania, and we came down the escalator in Trump Tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this. You have a lot of cameras here tonight.   It looked, literally, like the Academy Awards. I never saw so many cameras in my life. And it takes courage to run. I\u2019ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president. I\u2019ve never done this before. I\u2019ve been a job-producer. I\u2019ve done a lot of things but this is something I\u2019ve never done, but I felt we had to do it. When you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing. When you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted. We\u2019re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.   So it\u2019s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight. And if you want, press, I think we told you before we\u2019d be okay if you want to ask a few questions. Yes, go ahead.   Well, they can always do that and then they\u2019ll \u2014 then they\u2019ll just lose everything and that would be the \u2014 that would be the work of a loser. But let me just explain something. If you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened, whether you go to South Carolina, where I had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in New Hampshire, tremendous in Nevada, you look at what\u2019s happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all. I mean, right now, they\u2019re projected I guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states. It\u2019s Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts \u2014 (CHEERS) \u2014 Tennessee, Virginia. And you know, these are amazing states and we\u2019re going to probably get a lot more. In fact, we\u2019re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers. But I will say this. Look, we have expanded the Republican Party. When you look at what\u2019s happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in. They came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and they\u2019re Democrats and they\u2019re long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. And they were independents. And we\u2019ve actually expanded the party. Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example. Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes. We doubled it. We were almost 800,000. Whereas the Democrats went down. There\u2019s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats. So I \u2014 look, I\u2019m a unifier. I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unifier. Once we get all of this finished, I\u2019m going to go after one person, that\u2019s Hillary Clinton, on the assumption she\u2019s allowed to run, which is a big assumption. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to be allowed to run. And I think that\u2019s, frankly, going to be an easy race. You see the polls. I beat Hillary in many polls. I know one thing. I don\u2019t think Marco is going to be able to beat her. I don\u2019t think \u2014 in all fairness, I think Ted\u2019s going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he\u2019s won a little bit. So I just tell you this. We are going to be a much finer party, a much \u2014 we\u2019re going to be a unified party, I mean, to be honest with you. And we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening. We\u2019re going to be a much bigger party. Our party is expanding. And all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where I\u2019ve won and just look \u2014 we\u2019ve gone from X number to a much larger number. That hasn\u2019t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades. So I think we\u2019re going to be more inclusive. I think we\u2019re going to be more unified and I think we\u2019re going to be a much bigger party, and I think we\u2019re going to win in November.

Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we\u2019re really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I\u2019ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.   So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it\u2019s like we\u2019re in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.   You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.   Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.       Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that\u2019s being lost.   Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.   Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we\u2019re in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what\u2019s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.   Be careful of a bubble because what you\u2019ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.   And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.   SPEECH 7     Chris, thank you very much. I appreciate it. This has been an amazing evening.

Then they said, \"Oh, he\u2019ll never file his form whatever.\" That\u2019s a single page where basically you\u2019re signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement. I signed my form. And they said, \"Well, he\u2019ll never ever put in his financials.\" And you have like 90 days or something. And they said, \"He\u2019ll ask for extensions but he\u2019ll never show because he\u2019s probably not as rich as people think.\" But actually I\u2019m much richer and I put in my financials \u2013 it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. And Forbes and another group said, \"No, no, we don\u2019t know what these companies are.\" I put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud. I might have filed if I wasn\u2019t going to run. I wanted to show people. I wanted to brag. It\u2019s such a great company I\u2019ve built. So they said, \"He\u2019ll never put in his financials.\" I put in the financials. And everybody \u2013 they\u2019re much bigger. It\u2019s a much bigger \u2013 you know, very little debt, tremendous value. And really great assets. Iconic assets. You know, iconic. Doral, Turnberry in Scotland. I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world. And I\u2019m very proud of it. But they say, \"He\u2019ll never file. He\u2019ll never file.\" Then they see all these companies. And you know, they have boxes. And because it wasn\u2019t really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes.

Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn\u2019t do it   And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America\u2019s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.   In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.       We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.   Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.   Some say the Russians won\u2019t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can\u2019t make a deal under my administration, a deal that\u2019s great \u2014 not good, great \u2014 for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\u2019re going to find out.   Fixing our relations with China is another important step \u2014 and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.   We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it. No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to have to happen.   After I\u2019m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO\u2019s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.       I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.       I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.       Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we\u2019ve had the exact opposite \u2014 a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.   After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.   I will also be prepared to deploy America\u2019s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.       However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.   And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That\u2019s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.       We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.   Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.       These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that\u2019s what we want. We want them to be our allies.   We want the world to be \u2014 we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.   To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans.       Americans must know that we\u2019re putting the American people first again on trade.       So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.       No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.       And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.       NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states \u2014 literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I\u2019ve just gotten to see it. I\u2019ve toured Pennsylvania. I\u2019ve toured New York. I\u2019ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.   Never again, only the reverse \u2014 and I have to say this strongly \u2014 never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.   Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.       I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America\u2019s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.   The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.       And always \u2014 always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must \u2014 we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that \u2014 and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Our military is depleted and we\u2019re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.   We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.   But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We\u2019re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.     This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.   This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans...       Our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.       Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \u2014 and this was a horrible time for us \u2014 were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S. Cole.

I\u2019ve done an amazing job.   I started off \u2014 thank you \u2014 I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said \u2014 and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.   But he used to say, \"Donald, don\u2019t go into Manhattan. That\u2019s the big leagues. We don\u2019t know anything about that. Don\u2019t do it.\"   I said, \"I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I\u2019ve gotta do it.\"   And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals \u2014 the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I\u2019m building all over the world, and I love what I\u2019m doing.   But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, \"Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he\u2019s private and he\u2019s probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\"   So I said to myself, you know, nobody\u2019s ever going to know unless I run, because I\u2019m really proud of my success. I really am.       I\u2019ve employed \u2014 I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.

America must do more \u2014 much more \u2014 to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in Orlando. TRUMP: It also means we must change our foreign policy. The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before. These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region. That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism not nation building. No more nation building. It\u2019s never going to work. And by the way we\u2019ve spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the Middle East and it has been complete and total disaster. We\u2019re further away now than we were 15 years ago. For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton\u2019s war in Libya. That mission helped to unleash ISIS on a new continent. I\u2019ve said NATO need to change its focus and stop terrorism. We have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism. Since I\u2019ve raised that criticism and it\u2019s OK. I\u2019ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details \u2014 NATO has since announced a new initiative \u2014 front page of the Wall Street Journal four days ago focused on just that. America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism.   Pretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War.

Good evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state. In late 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City, and on Washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent. In Spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the Grand Marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel, many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk and I\u2019m glad I did. But I didn\u2019t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That\u2019s what politicians do. All talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother. The only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. I have been in business a long time. I know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for America, for Israel, and for the whole of the Middle East. The problem here is fundamental. We have rewarded the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return. I\u2019ve studied this issue in great detail. I would say actually, greater by far than anybody else. Believe me, and it\u2019s a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they\u2019ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them. The deal doesn\u2019t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad Iran\u2019s behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel. When I\u2019m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran\u2019s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I\u2019m not elected President, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to be elected president folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that please. Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally every day, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states. Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I\u2019ll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets. like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have. Now they\u2019re in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank they\u2019re openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist\u2019s home that\u2019s been destroyed. A deplorable, deplorable situation. Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East, and it\u2019s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror. Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran\u2019s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us. Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They\u2019ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me. Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold Iran totally accountable. And we will enforce it like you\u2019ve never seen a contract enforced before folks. Believe me. Iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe, and maybe someday hit even the United States. And we\u2019re not going to let that happen. We\u2019re not letting it happen, and we\u2019re not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.

I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to be allowed to run. What she did is a criminal act. If she\u2019s allowed to run I would be very, very surprised. But if she\u2019s allowed to run, honestly, it\u2019ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong. And what she did \u2014 (CHEERS) \u2014 let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price. OK, one or two more questions. Yeah, go ahead, Jeremy   At this moment, absolutely not, no. We either have a country or we don\u2019t. We have a country, or we don\u2019t. We have borders or we don\u2019t have borders.

And when I was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before I came in here because I wanted to see exactly where we were before I started speaking, I was amazed at the kind of numbers. The Republicans have tremendous energy. The Democrats don\u2019t. They don\u2019t have any energy. Their numbers are down. Our number are through the roof. And people are making the statements they\u2019ve never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized.

It could be nine, could win nine states tonight. If I\u2019m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if I\u2019m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that I might not win, I think, you know, we\u2019re a democracy.

But we have a lot of people coming \u2013 lots of congressmen. I have to thank Jeff Sessions \u2013 Sen. Jeff Sessions \u2013 one of the most respected men or people in Congress. And so many others. I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible. Jerry Falwell, Jr. Liberty University, I mean he is something. He is really a special person.

I have thousands and thousands of Hispanics. We're going to Nevada.   I lead -- I lead with the Hispanics. I'm leading in every poll with the Hispanics. They love me, I love them. The problem is -- the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it's Mexico or Japan or Viet Nam which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or China in particular -- that's the big one. The greatest abuse of a country that I think I've ever seen financially -- China.   What they've done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world.

They're going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country.     So we're going to do a lot of beautiful work. We're going to terminate Obamacare.

We spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world. Not even close. More per pupil -- second place doesn't even exist it's so different.

We are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they're told to have by senators and congressmen in Washington. We're going to have great equipment.        And the reason I can say that is I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these ...        I'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want. That's not going to happen.

He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.   The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don\u2019t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.   He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We\u2019ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama\u2019s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.   Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we\u2019ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we\u2019re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians.

We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we\u2019re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won\u2019t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.       Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton\u2019s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.   Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation.

Beautiful.  Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I\u2019d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace. It\u2019s time to shake the rust off America\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall. History will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another. They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama\u2019s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy. We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment. They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy. First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He\u2019s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. We\u2019re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem. I\u2019m the only one \u2014 believe me, I know them all, I\u2019m the only one who knows how to fix it. Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I\u2019ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.  The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.   Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can\u2019t depend on us. We\u2019ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we\u2019ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.     And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.     All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran\u2019s treatment of our ten captured sailors \u2014 so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.   When the other side knows you\u2019re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win \u2014 you just can\u2019t win.

Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.   President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we\u2019ve done.

Now, our country could never do that because we\u2019d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn\u2019t let our country \u2014 we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.   They\u2019re building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.   And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.   So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, \"That\u2019s a terrible story. I hate to hear it.\"   But I have another one, Ford.   So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It\u2019s going in and that\u2019s going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they\u2019re not going to Tennessee. They\u2019re gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.   Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it\u2019s going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.   So I announced that I\u2019m running for president. I would...       ... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t even use \u2014 you know, I have \u2014 I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.   You get a lot of them that are overrated. They\u2019re not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they\u2019re not good.   But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.   But I wouldn\u2019t even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I\u2019d say, \"Congratulations. I understand that you\u2019re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you\u2019re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.\"   And you say to yourself, \"How does that help us,\" right", "occurrence": 1}]}, "Then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections.

They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn\u2019t want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States. In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally. I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans\u2014many of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.   The Mexican Government wants an open border as long as it\u2019s a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.   I have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples\u2019 great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours. To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade. I have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something Mexico doesn\u2019t want me to say. In actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that Univision, previously my friend, went ballistic. I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security.   I have lost a lot during this Presidential run defending the people of the United States. I have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for President. Macy\u2019s, NBC, Serta and NASCAR have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. Univision, because 70% of their business comes from Mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the Mexican Government. The last thing Mexico wants is Donald Trump as President in that I will make great trade deals for the United States and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.   Interestingly, Univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful IPO or high stock price\u2014not to mention that I am currently suing them for breach of contract. Remember, Univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest backers. After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave \"reviews\"\u2014there was very little criticism. It wasn\u2019t until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words. If there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.   The issues I have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to Make America Great Again! Additionally, I would be the best jobs President that God ever created. Let\u2019s get to work!       TRUMP: (OFF-MIKE) This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what\u2019s going on, and especially how poor she\u2019d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism. TRUMP: Even her former Secret Service agent, who\u2019s seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech very, very soon. But today, there\u2019s only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders. The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country\u2019s history. So many people \u2014 it\u2019s just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace. The horror is beyond description. The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever. Likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated. We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families. We mourn as one people for our nation\u2019s loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it. I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack. Thank you. Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando\u2019s LGBT community. They have been through something that nobody could ever experience. This is a very dark moment in America\u2019s history. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation. It\u2019s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation. It\u2019s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity. It\u2019s an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country. We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination. But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly. We\u2019re not acting clearly, we\u2019re not talking clearly, we\u2019ve got problems. If we don\u2019t get tough, and if we don\u2019t get smart, and fast, we\u2019re not going to have our country anymore. There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left. The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don\u2019t share its radical views, and they murdered plenty. The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan. The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here. That is a fact, and it\u2019s a fact we need to talk about. We have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly. We have an incompetent administration. And if I\u2019m elected president, that will not change, I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years. We have an administration that will not change. But if I get in there, it\u2019s going to change, and it\u2019s going to change quickly. We\u2019re going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.   TRUMP: Thank you. With 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore. We have to address these issues head-on. I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and I have to say many years but many are saying that I was right to do so. And although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on. We have to do it. It will be lifted \u2014 this ban \u2014 when and as a nation we\u2019re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. They\u2019re pouring in and we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons. Now, any class \u2014 it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States. And it\u2019s as he or she deems appropriate. Hopefully it\u2019s he in this case.   Thank you. I will use this power to protect the American people. When I\u2019m elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there\u2019s a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats. After a full ...   Thank you. And by the way we have no choice. After a full and partial and long \u2014 really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.   We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer. Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.  Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American.   I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.   This is not just a national security issue. It\u2019s a quality of life issue. If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \u2014 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now.   We need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores. And it\u2019s coming ...   With these people, folks, it\u2019s coming. We\u2019re importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president. Even our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we\u2019re letting into America. All of the September 11th hijackists were issued visas. Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS. The Boston bombers came here through political asylum. The male shooter in San Bernardino again whose name I will not mention was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.   TRUMP: Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold \u2014 five fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law. We admit many more, and that\u2019s just the way it is. We admit many more from other countries in the region. And I\u2019ll tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values. We want to remain a free and open society. Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders. We have to control, and we have to control them now, not later. Right now.   Thank you. Yet Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday. And, guess what, she will probably say them. She sort of has said them, but let\u2019s see what happens. She really has no choice, but she doesn\u2019t want to. However, she\u2019s really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words. She supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what\u2019s going wrong with our country and our borders. She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is and she won\u2019t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know. She\u2019s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world \u2014 true weakness. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but just a few weeks before San Bernardino, the slaughter, that\u2019s all it was was a slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words \"radical Islam.\" Here is what she said, exact quote, \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\" That is Hillary Clinton. So, she says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. No good. Not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. Thank you. She wants to take away American\u2019s guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us. Let them come into the country, we don\u2019t have guns. Let them come in, let them have all the fun they want. I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. I will be always defending the Second Amendment.   Thank you. Thank you. The bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into American and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing. In fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life. When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. It\u2019s deadly \u2014 totally deadly. The Obama administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information. We need this information so badly, and he stopped it. We don\u2019t have the support. We don\u2019t have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their job. They are not being allowed to do their job. And, they can do it well \u2014 better than anybody. We need a new leader. We need a new leader fast.   TRUMP: Thank you. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else. I refuse to be politically correct.   I want to do the right thing. I want to straighten things out and I want to make America great again.   The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if I\u2019m elected. As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks. They don\u2019t have those tools now.   We need an intelligence gathering system second to none. Second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly. I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense who\u2019ll know how to fight a war on radical Islamic terrorism.   And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now. It\u2019s not right.   We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat. The Senate subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th. Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama\u2019s Department of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States. These Departments refused to comply. Nobody even knows why. They refused to comply. President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since September 11th. So important.

We\u2019re not going to be Hillary Clinton, and I watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again. Let me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, they\u2019re going to start to work again. Believe me. You\u2019re going to be proud again to be miners. So we\u2019ll be going there. I must say this tremendous run that we\u2019ve had started with New York when we had almost 62%. And don\u2019t forget, that\u2019s with three people. So 62% with two people is a massive landslide. But 63% almost \u2013 just a little over 62% \u2013 when you have that kind of a number with three people, it\u2019s actually unheard of. And all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, it\u2019s tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers. And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people. I think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in New York.

But when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that\u2019s not going to happen. Not going to happen. And if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences. I have to tell you that I\u2019ve competed all my life. Competitive person. All my life I\u2019ve been in competitions. Different competitions whether it\u2019s sports or business or now for 10 months politics. And I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party. You know, we started off with that 17 number. And just so you understand \u2013 Ted Cruz \u2013 I don\u2019t know if he likes me or if he doesn\u2019t like me. But he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy. And he has got an amazing future. He\u2019s got an amazing future. So I want to congratulate Ted. And I know how tough it is. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve had some moments where it\u2019s not looking so good, and it\u2019s not a great feeling. And so I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family. And I just want to say that one tough competitor and I can say that for the others. I mean, Chris Christie who endorsed me. Incredible guy. Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first. He just called me and said, \"It\u2019s a movement you\u2019ve got going. We\u2019ve got to do something because I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s an incredible movement.\" And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me. And I want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep Ben totally involved because we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win in November. And we\u2019re going to win big and it\u2019s going to be America first. You know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how we\u2019re the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don\u2019t respect us and they don\u2019t take care of us and they don\u2019t treat us right in many cases. And that\u2019s not going to happen. Now, we\u2019re going to keep things going and we\u2019re going to keep things going very nicely but we owe \u2013 soon \u2013 $21 trillion. It\u2019s $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion. And we\u2019re just not in a position that we\u2019re in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place.   So, we\u2019re going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries. But likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we\u2019ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers. So that will change. And I will tell you, they\u2019re going to end up liking us better than they do right. They\u2019re going to respect us. In this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China. The relationship is fantastic. We have great relationships with many foreign countries. But they have to respect us and they have to understand where we\u2019re coming from. And you know, it is a two-way street. And the two-way street means that we\u2019re going down one side and they\u2019re coming up the other. And we\u2019re going to meet and we are going to have something that\u2019s going to be really fabulous. Now, if that can\u2019t happen. If for some reason they want this system to continue the way it\u2019s going now, which is not fair and not good, where we\u2019re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East. And we have to build our infrastructure, our roads. We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country. We\u2019ve become close to a third world country. You look at some of our airports; it\u2019s third world. And then you go to other countries and you see places like you\u2019ve never seen. So I have to say that we are going to turn it around. We\u2019re going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It\u2019s the cheapest thing we can do. And we\u2019re going to have to take out ISIS and we\u2019re going to have to take them out fast. We can\u2019t allow that cancer to continue. We cannot allow it to continue. And you know, one group that\u2019s been so incredible to me are the vets \u2013 the veterans. And they\u2019ve been treated so badly. So badly. And we\u2019re going to get that straightened out. Now, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it\u2019s happened now with two or three. But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I\u2019m now leading Hillary Clinton. A lot of good things... And that\u2019s going to continue because they\u2019re not going to be able to do it, folks. They\u2019re not going to be able to make great trade deals. We have such bad deals. They\u2019re not going to be able to do what we do with the military. They\u2019re not going to be able to do what we\u2019re going to do on the border, including the wall. We\u2019re going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics. The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody want jobs. The African-Americans want jobs. You look at what\u2019s going on. They want jobs. And we\u2019re going to bring back our jobs. We\u2019re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again. And this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country. And we\u2019re going to love each other. We\u2019re going to cherish each other. We\u2019re going to take care of each other. And we\u2019re going to have great economic development. And we\u2019re not going to let other countries take it away from us because that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening for far too many years and we\u2019re not going to do it anymore. We\u2019re not going to do it anymore. I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to. He\u2019s doing a tremendous job.

And what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals. We\u2019re going to make the best trade deals you\u2019ve ever seen. We\u2019ve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business. And these people are going to be negotiating our deals and they\u2019re the best in the world. We have the best business people in the world. We\u2019re going to have such great deals. We\u2019re going to do so good with trade. We\u2019re going to do so good on the border.

I would have never thought this could have happened. I guess we\u2019re waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also. But to win the states that we\u2019ve won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, Florida. To win by that kind of a number is incredible. It\u2019s record-setting.   And I have to say that number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign. He\u2019s tough. He\u2019s smart. And he\u2019s got a great future. He\u2019s got a great future. But I have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have. Record, record, record. By the way, mostly false. I wouldn\u2019t say 100% but about 90%. Mostly false, vicious, horrible. They said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million. It added up to over $40 million. And you explain it to me because I can\u2019t \u2013 my numbers went up. I don\u2019t understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up.

And Adam, who\u2019s a great guy \u2013 I guess a lot of you folks saw that \u2013 but I\u2019m watching...we have television screens all over. We\u2019re down at this gorgeous green at Doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on. The worst commercial and I\u2019m with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives, and I\u2019m saying, \"Look over there! Look! Don\u2019t watch it. Don\u2019t.

He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I\u2019d say, you what, if he wants to \u2014 I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he\u2019d like to play, that\u2019s fine.       In fact, I\u2019d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.       But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who\u2019s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, \"Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It\u2019s a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.\"   We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be \u2014 and \u2014 and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. So I\u2019ve watched the politicians. I\u2019ve dealt with them all my life. If you can\u2019t make a good deal with a politician, then there\u2019s something wrong with you. You\u2019re certainly not very good. And that\u2019s what we have= representing us.

It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.   But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste.

Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \u2014 and this was a horrible time for us \u2014 were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S. Cole.

We\u2019re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water\u2019s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.     This is how we won the Cold War and it\u2019s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.       First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it\u2019s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.   In this, we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.   We should work \u2014 thank you.       We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It\u2019s now two-way. And remember, us and all we\u2019re doing, they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done to them. We\u2019re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.   A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what\u2019s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked \u2014 one of the true great catastrophes.   And then there\u2019s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won\u2019t tell them where and I won\u2019t tell them how.

The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what\u2019s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately.

So when I started, I said we have to do something about it. It\u2019s not something I wanted to do. It\u2019s something we have to do. Because I\u2019m representing you. I\u2019m not taking any money. I\u2019m not, you know, like some of these guys where they\u2019re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know and they\u2019re nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country. They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they\u2019re representing. And these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they\u2019re told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors. Me, I\u2019m going to do the right thing.

It\u2019s going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be easy. So, I started and I talked about the border. Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration. Took a lot of heat. But you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about that subject if I didn\u2019t bring it up. And I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about. But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed. And by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way. We\u2019re going to protect the Second Amendment. We\u2019re going to protect the guns. We\u2019re going to protect your guns. You know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married. She came on a fiancee permit...You know, wonderful fiancee. She was totally radicalized. Maybe radicalized him. Maybe he was already that way. But we\u2019ve got to start thinking. We have to start using our head. Bad stuff is happening. We have to find out what\u2019s going on. We have a president who won\u2019t even talk about the term. If you think, he won\u2019t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on. And you can\u2019t solve the problem if you don\u2019t talk about it. You have to talk about it. So, very, very strongly we started talking about that. And then after Paris \u2013 and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world. You can\u2019t have a gun unless you\u2019re bad guy, you bought a gun. And they walked in just said \"Boom! Boom! Boom! You, move over. Boom!\" Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded. But if we had a couple of \u2013 few of the people that I pointed out \u2013 I could plenty in this audience, believe me. But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks. It\u2019d be a whole different story.   So very, very big on the Second Amendment. But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more. I went up 11 points. I don\u2019t want to do it for that reason. But it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great. I love John Wayne. From Iowa. But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who\u2019s an incredible woman, and she said, \"We\u2019d like to endorse you.\" John Wayne was a strong guy.

At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were\u2026but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center.

Nobody\u2019s leaving here except for the one person that was screaming. So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s not their thing to do. You know, we get the biggest crowds. They don\u2019t want to show this crowd tonight. They\u2019re not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don\u2019t do that. They have the cameras right in my face.

I had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said \"Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early.\" I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes.

We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That\u2019s the negotiator we have.   Take a look at the deal he\u2019s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won\u2019t exist very long. It\u2019s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But... So we need people \u2014 I\u2019m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don\u2019t have talented people, if you don\u2019t have great leadership, if you don\u2019t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.

So, we\u2019re going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again. It\u2019s a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again. Too few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet. This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business. It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction. It will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn\u2019t seen for decades. And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit. But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we\u2019ve got to make our economy strong. Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. We\u2019re going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. If you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 \u2013 so, very important. If you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you\u2019ll not pay any income tax \u2013 nothing. This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty. It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax. It ends the death tax. It\u2019s a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax. It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true \u2013 while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly. It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest. So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital. Changes for business \u2013 now, so important, because it\u2019s all about business. It\u2019s all about jobs. We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can\u2019t work. So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction. A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount \u2013 10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Now, it\u2019s called corporate inversion. It\u2019s a huge subject. I\u2019ve been watching politicians now for years \u2013 all talk, no action politicians. I\u2019ve been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back.   The number is probably $2.5 trillion. Everybody agrees it should come back \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, everybody. They can\u2019t make a deal. They don\u2019t know how to go about making a deal. The reason companies aren\u2019t bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn\u2019t make sense to bring it back. And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They\u2019re leaving our shores to go and collect their money. They\u2019re going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons \u2013 the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can\u2019t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in. It\u2019s called leadership. We will have that money brought back in. As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can\u2019t bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We\u2019ve been doing this for a year and a half. We can\u2019t get it back in. So the money stays in other countries and that\u2019s what happens. Not good for us. The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something \u2013 and I\u2019ve been watching it for a long time \u2013 everybody agrees to. We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes \u2013 many of them actually \u2013 and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income. The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don\u2019t make sense, and which are unfair are gone. And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense. So we are going to give you \u2013 we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we\u2019re going to hand them out right now to the press. And I think you\u2019ll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair. It\u2019s graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more. Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer. But I actually believe they\u2019ll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we\u2019ll have something very special. Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what\u2019s going on in this country.

The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, we will, I promise we will. Which brings me to my next point. The utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It\u2019s not a friend to freedom. It\u2019s not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know, it has its home. And it surely is not a friend to Israel. With President Obama in his final year, yay! He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me. Believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear. An agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster. The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president, 100 percent. When people ask why, it\u2019s because that\u2019s not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together. They come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something it values, I mean we have to do something where there\u2019s value in exchange for something that it requires. That\u2019s what a deal is. A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That\u2019s not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It\u2019s not going to happen folks. And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they\u2019re stabbing Israelis, and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenol young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don\u2019t reward behavior like that. You can not do it! There is only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it! So, it\u2019s not up the United Nations to go with a solution. It\u2019s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. You have no choice. They have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don\u2019t even really know what\u2019s happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It\u2019s so preposterous. We\u2019re not going to let that happen. When I\u2019m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. You see, I know about deal-making. That\u2019s what I do. I wrote \u2018The Art of the Deal\u2019. One of the best-selling, all-time, and I mean seriously, I\u2019m saying \u2018one of\u2019, because I\u2019ll be criticized as though I say \u2018the\u2019, so I\u2019m going to be very diplomatic. One of... I\u2019ll be criticized. I think it is number one, but why take a chance. One of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making. To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000, where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous. Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer. The Palestinian Authority rejected it also. Then John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didn\u2019t even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn\u2019t even respond. When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One. And when I say something, I mean it. I mean it. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we\u2019ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and hate the Jews. It has to stop. When you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero\u2019s, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. we can\u2019t let this continue. We can\u2019t let this happen any longer. You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible, horrible way to think. It\u2019s a barrier that can\u2019t be broken. That will end, and it\u2019ll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you\u2019ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they\u2019ve got to go out, and they\u2019ve got to start this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it, and now! There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies. And you see that happening all the time. That pattern practiced by the President and his administration, including former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly. But its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn\u2019t happen. President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it\u2019s precisely the opposite that happened. Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it\u2019s a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We\u2019ll get it solved, one way or the other. We will get it solved. But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially. That\u2019s what will happen when Donald Trump is President of the United States. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish State and it will forever exist as a Jewish State. I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I\u2019ve been with Israel so long in terms of, I\u2019ve received some of my greatest honors from Israel. My father before me, incredible.

He didn't know what he was doing. Iraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.

But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control. Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary.

We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status. We have to know, and we have to know fast.

Big consequences.   America must do more \u2014 much more \u2014 to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in Orlando. TRUMP: It also means we must change our foreign policy. The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before. These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region. That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism not nation building. No more nation building. It\u2019s never going to work. And by the way we\u2019ve spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the Middle East and it has been complete and total disaster. We\u2019re further away now than we were 15 years ago. For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton\u2019s war in Libya. That mission helped to unleash ISIS on a new continent. I\u2019ve said NATO need to change its focus and stop terrorism. We have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism. Since I\u2019ve raised that criticism and it\u2019s OK. I\u2019ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details \u2014 NATO has since announced a new initiative \u2014 front page of the Wall Street Journal four days ago focused on just that. America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism.   Pretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War. We tried it President Obama\u2019s way, doesn\u2019t work. He gave the world his apology tour. We got ISIS and many other problems in return. That\u2019s what we got.

Good evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state. In late 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City, and on Washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent. In Spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the Grand Marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel, many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk and I\u2019m glad I did. But I didn\u2019t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That\u2019s what politicians do. All talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother. The only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. I have been in business a long time. I know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for America, for Israel, and for the whole of the Middle East. The problem here is fundamental. We have rewarded the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return. I\u2019ve studied this issue in great detail. I would say actually, greater by far than anybody else. Believe me, and it\u2019s a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they\u2019ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them. The deal doesn\u2019t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad Iran\u2019s behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel. When I\u2019m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran\u2019s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I\u2019m not elected President, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that\u2019s why I\u2019m going to be elected president folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that please. Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally every day, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states. Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I\u2019ll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets. like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have. Now they\u2019re in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank they\u2019re openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist\u2019s home that\u2019s been destroyed. A deplorable, deplorable situation. Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East, and it\u2019s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror. Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran\u2019s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us. Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They\u2019ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me. Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold Iran totally accountable. And we will enforce it like you\u2019ve never seen a contract enforced before folks. Believe me. Iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times.

The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different. I don\u2019t think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they\u2019re not silent. People are not silent. They\u2019re disgusted with our incompetent politicians. They\u2019re disgusted with the people that are giving our country away. They\u2019re disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job. They\u2019re disgusted when they\u2019re allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they\u2019re standing there helpless and people just pour into the country. They\u2019re disgusted when a woman who\u2019s nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years. They\u2019re disgusted by what\u2019s happening to our country. And you\u2019re going to look around and you\u2019re going to remember who the people are that are here because we\u2019re doing something special. This is a movement. We\u2019re going to make our country great again. Believe me, we will make our country great again. I love you all. Thank you very much.   Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor. The Chairman just left as you probably know and he\u2019s been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period. And as you know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted. I wanted fairness. I don\u2019t have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party. We\u2019re leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we\u2019re over 30%. We\u2019ve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%. And frankly, I\u2019ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it\u2019s Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what\u2019s happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up. And for that reason, I have signed the pledge. So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win. And most importantly, we will make our country great again because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. We have to make our country great again.       This is a self-funded campaign. We have our heart in it. We have our soul in it. I don\u2019t need money and I don\u2019t want money. And this is going to be a campaign like I think no other. I\u2019m not controlled by lobbyists. I\u2019m not controlled by anybody. I\u2019m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again.       Yeah, I got nothing. I really got nothing.

And they\u2019re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they\u2019re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we\u2019re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll do it. Because a lot of people said, \"He\u2019ll never run. Number one, he won\u2019t want to give up his lifestyle.\"   They\u2019re right about that, but I\u2019m doing it.   Number two, I\u2019m a private company, so nobody knows what I\u2019m worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.   So I said, \"That\u2019s OK.\" I\u2019m proud of my net worth. I\u2019ve done an amazing job.   I started off \u2014 thank you \u2014 I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said \u2014 and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.   But he used to say, \"Donald, don\u2019t go into Manhattan. That\u2019s the big leagues. We don\u2019t know anything about that. Don\u2019t do it.\"   I said, \"I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I\u2019ve gotta do it.\"   And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals \u2014 the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I\u2019m building all over the world, and I love what I\u2019m doing.   But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, \"Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he\u2019s private and he\u2019s probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\"   So I said to myself, you know, nobody\u2019s ever going to know unless I run, because I\u2019m really proud of my success. I really am.       I\u2019ve employed \u2014 I\u2019ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.   So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it\u2019s big and complex, and they\u2019ve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don\u2019t extensions or anything. We\u2019ll be filing it right on time. We don\u2019t need anything.       And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, \"He had assets of $9 billion.\" So I said (ph), \"No, that\u2019s the wrong number. That\u2019s the wrong number. Not assets.\"   So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It\u2019s real estate. You know, it\u2019s real estate.   It\u2019s labor, and it\u2019s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren\u2019t in unions, and it\u2019s all over the place and building all over the world.   And I have assets \u2014 big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected \u2014 9 billion 240 million dollars.   And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). That\u2019s long-term debt, very low interest rates.   In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, \"Donald, you don\u2019t have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion\"", "occurrence": 1}]}, "They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it.  Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great.  But they talk about it.  And then you have a president that does an executive order.  Nobody even heard of an executive order.  He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.  Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.  Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it.  We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.  So we have to do something. Jobs.  China.  I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese.  One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it.  And I know them.  And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with.  We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.  They tell me that.  Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.  But they tell me that. And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries.  The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.  I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing.  They are devaluing down to nothing.  And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.  And they're getting away with it.  And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.  But you watch this devaluation of all of it.  I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.  And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.  You know it's one of those things, sounds good.  Be very careful.  Be very careful.  Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.  They have it set.  Don't forget another thing.  China became the number one economic power a year ago.  That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.  It was absolutely unthinkable.  So it happened and it's very, very sad. Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.  We got nothing.  They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us.  Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.  We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.  By the way, you know how they formed.  They took the oil.  And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.  So now ISIS has the oil.  And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take.  So we get nothing.  We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.  I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.  And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.  But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.  We have incompetent people.  They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing.  It needs money. We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security.  'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security.  I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid.  Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security.  And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.  It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things. Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.  We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.  We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.  We can't do it.  Can't do it.  We cannot let that happen.  You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other. Here we are in Syria.  We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.  Think of this.  We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government.  Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.  But think of it; think of it.  ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.  There are so many things; there are so many things. But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.  Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.  You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.  The power.  And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.  We've never had this before. We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there.  We're trying to do the right thing.  We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.  You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find.  The same thing is happening there.  And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.  And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals.  They're taking it out.  Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.  So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.  It's really, really crazy. So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.  If we don't--  The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed.  Bridges are collapsing all over the country.  The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure. I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai.  I go to various different places.  I go to China.  They are building a bridge on every corner.  They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff.  They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.  They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say \"cutter\" but I've always said \"qatar\" so I'll keep it \"qatar\" what the hell.  But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.  And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes.  The place is falling apart.  You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart.  And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.  So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.  This is inside, not outside.  And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.  In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor.  I said it's not an honor; they're just smart.  But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling. You look at all of the things that are bad--  I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.  You know the guard rails.  The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.  Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.  Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.  Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.  Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.  Somebody made a lot of money on that.  They don't know what is happening. So we have to make our country great again.  We have to rebuild our country.  And we have a long way to go.  We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.  Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it.  We owe it to other countries.  They're the ones that hold the debt.  And then we give them money.  We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies.  I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know--  No American company comes to see and comes to bid.

And to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.     \u2026It\u2019s a great honor. I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I\u2019ve heard about Simon and Schuster\u2019s being a fabulous \u2013 I was going to say the Rolls-Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You\u2019ve given us such tremendous support. And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It\u2019s been an incredible experience. We wrote a book and the title \u2013 \"Crippled America\" \u2013 is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we\u2019ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth. And America is crippled. We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now it\u2019s actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt. We have a military that doesn\u2019t have proper instruction from leadership. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re losing all over the world with trade deals. Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they\u2019re beating us in trade. And we can\u2019t go on like this any longer. It\u2019s impossible to go on like this any longer. I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s going to work anymore. So we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it\u2019s going to be very instructional, very important. To me, it was instructional. When I did \"The Art of the Deal\", I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book \"The Art of the Deal\" and the other books we\u2019ve done. So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what\u2019s going on right now. It\u2019s a moment of time. And we got it done. And David did a fantastic job\u2026And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in.   But we see by the lines \u2013 the lines go down to Park Avenue. They\u2019ve been forming since last night and I\u2019m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. We\u2019re doing a couple of interviews and then we\u2019re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that\u2019ll be very exciting for me. But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing this but they do it. They find a way. So I\u2019m looking forward to getting to the signings. \u2026       Well, I think it\u2019s a different book. You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where I\u2019m leading. You saw the new poll from Iowa. You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where I\u2019m leading big. A poll just came out in Florida where I\u2019m leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place. And I think you know look we\u2019re doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we\u2019re beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we\u2019re beating \u2013 they call it the establishment. It\u2019s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down. But I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how his book is doing.       Well, I think my book is very hard-hitting. His is a different kind of book and he\u2019s a different kind of a person. My book is very hard-hitting. It says it like it is. And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, it\u2019s selling like hotcakes. So we\u2019ll see.       We\u2019re very different people. We have very different qualities and we are extremely different. And I\u2019m different from all of the other candidates. Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me. We are going to take the $400 billion a year that we\u2019re losing with China, that\u2019s going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we\u2019re short on with Japan. The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that\u2019s right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally. So I mean, much different than \u2013 you\u2019re look at Marco Rubio \u2013 very, very weak on illegal immigration. You look at Ben and he\u2019s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can\u2019t get rid of Medicare. It\u2019d be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don\u2019t know how he stays here.       No, I think that really Marco is over-rated. And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message. I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn\u2019t been able to \u2013 Marco doesn\u2019t show up to the United States Senate. He\u2019s representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and I\u2019m way up in Florida over everybody. But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn\u2019t show up for the people of Florida, and I don\u2019t think he should be doing that. Now, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush\u2019s side and ultimately I think Marco\u2019s going to be hurt very badly. And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he\u2019s coming from, I think people are going to say, \"Whoa, we didn\u2019t know that.\" But look at Marco\u2019s stance on illegal immigration. It\u2019s really trouble for him. I don\u2019t see how he can win.       Marco Rubio\u2019s personal finances are discredit\u2026All you have to do is look at his credit card. I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I love Florida. I\u2019m in Florida all the time. And for years, I\u2019ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster. I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that. But his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I\u2019ve heard about it for years. You\u2019ll have to find out.       Well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his \u2013 you know, he certainly lives above his means. There\u2019s no question about that.   \u2026I\u2019ll tell you what. On the debates, it\u2019s very interesting. Because I don\u2019t really care that much. I want a room. I want a podium. And let\u2019s get going. Because I don\u2019t really care that much. But a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect \u2013 many of them, not all of them \u2013 but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls. I mean, she wasn\u2019t asked one tough question. They didn\u2019t talk about her foundation. They didn\u2019t talk about any of the problems. They didn\u2019t talk about the emails. When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign. I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint. In order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails. That was end of his campaign. First of all, people aren\u2019t going to his rallies anymore. He\u2019s finished. So unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she\u2019ll easily be the candidate. But I will say this: She only got softballs. That\u2019s all she got. And if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn\u2019t the same way. With that being said, I don\u2019t really care.       Well, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall. They coalesced at that last debate because I mean, it really started with me. The guy asked me a question. I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter. He\u2019s a disaster. And he was \u2013 it was such as horribly put question and so obvious. And the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it. And all we want to do is to be treated fairly. But with me, I don\u2019t care that much. Just give me a podium. What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else. You know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn\u2019t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched.

I was a big contributor. Nobody knows the system. But I was on the other side. And I was the elite. I was the fair hair person. Once I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider. I became an outsider because I was running. Because I wasn\u2019t supposed to run. I\u2019m this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman. But I\u2019m not supposed to be running for office. The fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade. And I\u2019m not knocking those countries. Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders. They are absolutely killing us. China \u2013 taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base.

They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. That\u2019s not going to happen with me.         \u2026Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man. I\u2019ll be honest.

He\u2019s getting the money from lobbyists and his donors. And they\u2019re making him do it because he\u2019s crashing in the polls. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I know that my life will continue. I just don\u2019t know. I mean nobody\u2019s ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I\u2019ve done. You know, one of the things I\u2019m most honored about is that so far everybody that\u2019s attacked me has gone down the tubes. You have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he\u2019s at zero. You have Perry attacked me. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he\u2019s getting out of the race. He was at zero.

It\u2019s going to be a friend again. We\u2019re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.       We\u2019re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water\u2019s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties \u2014 Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.     This is how we won the Cold War and it\u2019s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.       First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it\u2019s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.   In this, we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.   We should work \u2014 thank you.       We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It\u2019s now two-way. And remember, us and all we\u2019re doing, they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done to them. We\u2019re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we\u2019ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There\u2019s no documentation. There\u2019s no paperwork. There\u2019s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.   A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what\u2019s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked \u2014 one of the true great catastrophes.   And then there\u2019s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won\u2019t tell them where and I won\u2019t tell them how. We must...       ... we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We\u2019re sending troops. We tell them. We\u2019re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.   But they\u2019re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I\u2019m elected president. And they\u2019ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.       Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what\u2019s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.

We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we\u2019re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won\u2019t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.       Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton\u2019s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.   Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation.

It also means we must change our foreign policy.   The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.   These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.   That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.   For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.   I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.   America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.   We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.

Not only the number of deaths, which are obviously \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going on is incredible. But as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days. And it\u2019s not going to happen. Not going to happen. If I win, believe me, it\u2019s not going to happen. And one of the things I thought I\u2019d do and I\u2019d stress so strongly \u2013 the veterans hospitals \u2013 obviously they have problems. They\u2019re not properly run. And when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say \"I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m going on vacation\", believe me, it doesn\u2019t get much worse than that. So we\u2019re going to create a whole new system. We\u2019re going to take this system apart. And if they\u2019re not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we\u2019re going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals. And you\u2019re going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it. And that\u2019s going to be broken down into something that\u2019s going to be very special. Right now \u2013 and you know it \u2013 we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore. It\u2019s not going to happen. So, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected. To be here is an honor. They don\u2019t build ships like this anymore, folks.

If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS\u2019s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.   The Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn\u2019t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn\u2019t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.   For a religious leader to question a person\u2019s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man\u2019s religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.

Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great.  But they talk about it.  And then you have a president that does an executive order.  Nobody even heard of an executive order.  He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.  Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.  Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it.  We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.  So we have to do something. Jobs.  China.  I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese.  One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it.  And I know them.  And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with.  We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.  They tell me that.  Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.  But they tell me that. And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries.  The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.  I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing.  They are devaluing down to nothing.  And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.  And they're getting away with it.  And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.  But you watch this devaluation of all of it.  I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.  And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.  You know it's one of those things, sounds good.  Be very careful.  Be very careful.  Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.  They have it set.  Don't forget another thing.  China became the number one economic power a year ago.  That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.  It was absolutely unthinkable.  So it happened and it's very, very sad. Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.  We got nothing.  They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us.  Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.  We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.  By the way, you know how they formed.  They took the oil.  And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.  So now ISIS has the oil.  And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take.  So we get nothing.  We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.  I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.  And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.  But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.  We have incompetent people.  They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing.  It needs money. We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security.  'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security.  I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid.  Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security.  And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.  It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things. Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.  We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.  We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.  We can't do it.  Can't do it.  We cannot let that happen.  You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other. Here we are in Syria.  We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.  Think of this.  We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government.  Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.  But think of it; think of it.  ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.  There are so many things; there are so many things. But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.  Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.  You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.  The power.  And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.  We've never had this before. We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there.  We're trying to do the right thing.  We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.  You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find.  The same thing is happening there.  And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.  And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals.  They're taking it out.  Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.  So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.  It's really, really crazy. So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.  If we don't--  The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed.  Bridges are collapsing all over the country.  The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure. I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai.  I go to various different places.  I go to China.  They are building a bridge on every corner.  They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff.  They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.  They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say \"cutter\" but I've always said \"qatar\" so I'll keep it \"qatar\" what the hell.  But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.  And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes.  The place is falling apart.  You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart.  And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.  So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.  This is inside, not outside.  And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.  In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor.  I said it's not an honor; they're just smart.  But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling. You look at all of the things that are bad--  I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.  You know the guard rails.  The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.  Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.  Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.  Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.  Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.  Somebody made a lot of money on that.  They don't know what is happening. So we have to make our country great again.  We have to rebuild our country.  And we have a long way to go.  We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.  Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it.  We owe it to other countries.  They're the ones that hold the debt.  And then we give them money.  We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies.

They didn\u2019t know what it was for. And again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying.

Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think I\u2019ll go over $6 million pretty easily. Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building. But nobody talks about that. So we raised $5.6 million. We have so many happy groups. So many happy veterans. And then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside. Now, of course, they don\u2019t know the extent.

We have a circle of veterans. I don\u2019t want to send a $250,000 check to a group that doesn\u2019t do good work. So it\u2019s called vetting. We vet the vets. But it\u2019s called vetting.       I think it\u2019s bothersome because I love the vets and I\u2019ve worked hard for the vets. And as you can see, I\u2019ve given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets.

They\u2019re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately. We\u2019re losing thousands of people waiting on line.

So I'm here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system \u2014 we are in a rigged, rigged system \u2014 and to make America safe again and to make America great again. I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We've witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it's happening more and more. And it's never going to stop. We need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I'm elected president, that will happen. I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation. And as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they're resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot \u2014 a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it'll all work out. Now, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what's happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don't even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn't know what he was doing. Iraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn't get our hostages until the end. Now we're seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems. We also need to bring back in this country \u2014 because we see what happened \u2014 our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They've been taken away, like we're babies. Taken away. And we're going to bring them back. I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous \u2014 really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I've admired the work he's done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I'm going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute. But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he's going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person. Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He's really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state's way by the Obama administration. It's horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it's out of control. Mike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She's a corrupt person. What she's done with her e-mails, what she's done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She's totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She's crooked Hillary. And I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails \u2014 but it wasn't a loss, she discarded \u2014 that in itself is a major crime.

Remember the poll numbers. So remember this. So listen. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans \u2013 these are people that are here by the way, people that are here \u2013 25% not 1%. By the way, 1% would be unacceptable. 1% is unacceptable. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part \u2013 think of that \u2013 as part of the global jihad. They want to change your religion. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. Not going to happen. As part of the global jihad. And 51% of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51%. Sharia authorizes \u2013 now look, this is, I mean, it\u2019s terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won\u2019t convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look \u2013 especially women. Tough stuff. And we have a president that won\u2019t even mention the term and you\u2019re talking about numbers like this. Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it\u2019s obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension\u2026 Where the hatred comes from and why, we\u2019ll have to determine. We\u2019ll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can\u2019t live like this. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse. You\u2019re going to have more World Trade Centers. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse folks. We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it\u2019s going to get worse and worse. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad. These are people only believe in jihad. They don\u2019t want our system. They don\u2019t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life.   \u2026So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn\u2019t have had the carnage that you had in Paris. You wouldn\u2019t had that carnage. If they had guns, you wouldn\u2019t had that carnage. So important the Second Amendment. We have to preserve it and cherish it. And we can\u2019t let these weak leaders diminish it. If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice. \"Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom!\" People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying. They\u2019re sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die. Now, the same thing a few days ago in California. No guns. We didn\u2019t have guns. The bad guys had the guns. And these young people \u2013 and I tell the press you\u2019ve got to stop calling them \"masterminds\" \u2013 these are dirty, rotten scums. These aren\u2019t masterminds.

Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn\u2019t do it   And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America\u2019s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.   In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.       We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.   Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.   Some say the Russians won\u2019t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can\u2019t make a deal under my administration, a deal that\u2019s great \u2014 not good, great \u2014 for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\u2019re going to find out.   Fixing our relations with China is another important step \u2014 and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.   We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They\u2019re not supposed to be doing it. No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to have to happen.   After I\u2019m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO\u2019s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.       I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.       I will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.       Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we\u2019ve had the exact opposite \u2014 a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.   After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.   I will also be prepared to deploy America\u2019s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.       However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.   And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That\u2019s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9s but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.       We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.   Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.       These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that\u2019s what we want. We want them to be our allies.   We want the world to be \u2014 we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.   To achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans.       Americans must know that we\u2019re putting the American people first again on trade.       So true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.       No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.       And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.       NAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states \u2014 literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I\u2019ve just gotten to see it. I\u2019ve toured Pennsylvania. I\u2019ve toured New York. I\u2019ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.   Never again, only the reverse \u2014 and I have to say this strongly \u2014 never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.   Under a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.       I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America\u2019s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.   The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.       And always \u2014 always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must \u2014 we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that \u2014 and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.

I just think this is a common sense approach. You know, we could say supply side. You could say there\u2019s 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s supply side or anything else. I think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that\u2019s going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work. It\u2019s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs. One of the other things that I\u2019m coupling this with is if I become President, I\u2019m going to renegotiate our trade deals. Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country. Not sustainable. We cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries. There\u2019s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn\u2019t make a better deal. Everybody. We lose money with everything. I\u2019m also going to renegotiate some of our military costs. Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 we protect everybody. We protect everybody. And we don\u2019t get reimbursement. We lose on everything. We lose on everything. So, we\u2019re going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that\u2019s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly. I\u2019m not showing a big number in that. But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive. As an example, Saudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. We protect them. So we need help. We\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion. I used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now it\u2019s $19 trillion and it\u2019s only going up.       Well, no, look. Senator [Marco] Rubio is a lightweight. We understand that. He wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. He wouldn\u2019t know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is they\u2019re trying to take \u2013 we just went up in the last poll. We went up two points in the last poll, and we continue to go up. In the NBC poll, I think we went from 26% to 29%. We\u2019re going up very strongly in the polls. They don\u2019t know what to do about it. I\u2019ve built a great company. You\u2019ll see that in 60 Minutes last night. I built a great company. It\u2019s a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow. I\u2019m funding my own campaign. Guys like Rubio, I mean, he desperately needs money. Ask the car dealer in Florida. Ask the people that support him. And a guy like Rubio and others \u2013 I don\u2019t want to single him out; you\u2019re singling him out \u2013 but they\u2019re largely controlled by their donors, the special interests, and frankly more than anybody else, the lobbyists. I\u2019ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it\u2019s not the right thing. It\u2019s just not right. And that seems to be resonating very strongly.         I negotiate. It\u2019s true. I get bills from people; I\u2019ll negotiate.

Likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.

America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.   Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven\u2019t budged in many years.   So whether it\u2019s matter of national security, or financial security, we can\u2019t afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.   All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.   I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad \u2013 and they do know where they are.   I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.   I want to protect our citizens \u2013 all of our citizens.   The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.   In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.   We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.   We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.   We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.   We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan \u2013 including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us \u2013 is brought to justice.   If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .   America must do more \u2013 much more \u2013 to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.   It also means we must change our foreign policy.   The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.   These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.   That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.   For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton's war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.   I've said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I've raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.   America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.   We've tried it President Obama's way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.   I'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.   When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.   America will be a tolerant and open society.   America will also be a safe society.   We will protect our borders at home.   We will defeat ISIS overseas.   We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.   We will make America rich again.   We will make America safe again.   We will make American Great Again.   Thank you.   ...We\u2019re doing really well. Iowa\u2019s been amazing.

Not going to happen anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore. We\u2019re going to bring back our jobs and we\u2019re going to keep our jobs. We\u2019re not going to let companies leave. Now, if they want to go to a different state, good luck, compete. But when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that\u2019s not going to happen. Not going to happen. And if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences. I have to tell you that I\u2019ve competed all my life. Competitive person. All my life I\u2019ve been in competitions. Different competitions whether it\u2019s sports or business or now for 10 months politics. And I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party. You know, we started off with that 17 number. And just so you understand \u2013 Ted Cruz \u2013 I don\u2019t know if he likes me or if he doesn\u2019t like me. But he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy. And he has got an amazing future. He\u2019s got an amazing future. So I want to congratulate Ted. And I know how tough it is. It\u2019s tough. It\u2019s tough. I\u2019ve had some moments where it\u2019s not looking so good, and it\u2019s not a great feeling. And so I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family. And I just want to say that one tough competitor and I can say that for the others. I mean, Chris Christie who endorsed me. Incredible guy. Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first. He just called me and said, \"It\u2019s a movement you\u2019ve got going. We\u2019ve got to do something because I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s an incredible movement.\" And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me. And I want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep Ben totally involved because we\u2019re going to win. We\u2019re going to win in November. And we\u2019re going to win big and it\u2019s going to be America first. You know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how we\u2019re the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don\u2019t respect us and they don\u2019t take care of us and they don\u2019t treat us right in many cases. And that\u2019s not going to happen. Now, we\u2019re going to keep things going and we\u2019re going to keep things going very nicely but we owe \u2013 soon \u2013 $21 trillion. It\u2019s $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion. And we\u2019re just not in a position that we\u2019re in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place.   So, we\u2019re going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries. But likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we\u2019ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers. So that will change. And I will tell you, they\u2019re going to end up liking us better than they do right. They\u2019re going to respect us. In this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China. The relationship is fantastic. We have great relationships with many foreign countries. But they have to respect us and they have to understand where we\u2019re coming from. And you know, it is a two-way street. And the two-way street means that we\u2019re going down one side and they\u2019re coming up the other. And we\u2019re going to meet and we are going to have something that\u2019s going to be really fabulous. Now, if that can\u2019t happen. If for some reason they want this system to continue the way it\u2019s going now, which is not fair and not good, where we\u2019re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East. And we have to build our infrastructure, our roads. We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country. We\u2019ve become close to a third world country. You look at some of our airports; it\u2019s third world. And then you go to other countries and you see places like you\u2019ve never seen. So I have to say that we are going to turn it around. We\u2019re going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It\u2019s the cheapest thing we can do. And we\u2019re going to have to take out ISIS and we\u2019re going to have to take them out fast. We can\u2019t allow that cancer to continue. We cannot allow it to continue. And you know, one group that\u2019s been so incredible to me are the vets \u2013 the veterans. And they\u2019ve been treated so badly. So badly. And we\u2019re going to get that straightened out. Now, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it\u2019s happened now with two or three. But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I\u2019m now leading Hillary Clinton. A lot of good things... And that\u2019s going to continue because they\u2019re not going to be able to do it, folks. They\u2019re not going to be able to make great trade deals. We have such bad deals. They\u2019re not going to be able to do what we do with the military. They\u2019re not going to be able to do what we\u2019re going to do on the border, including the wall. We\u2019re going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics. The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody want jobs. The African-Americans want jobs. You look at what\u2019s going on. They want jobs. And we\u2019re going to bring back our jobs. We\u2019re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again. And this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country. And we\u2019re going to love each other. We\u2019re going to cherish each other. We\u2019re going to take care of each other. And we\u2019re going to have great economic development. And we\u2019re not going to let other countries take it away from us because that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening for far too many years and we\u2019re not going to do it anymore. We\u2019re not going to do it anymore. I want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to. He\u2019s doing a tremendous job. It\u2019s not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess he\u2019s down to one.   I don\u2019t know.

I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I\u2019d say, you what, if he wants to \u2014 I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he\u2019d like to play, that\u2019s fine.       In fact, I\u2019d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.       But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who\u2019s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, \"Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It\u2019s a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good.

CBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we\u2019re at 35% to a small number. We\u2019re killing everybody in every poll. Just one little outlier here. ...Again, I\u2019m sure when Des Moines comes out it\u2019ll be a negative because I don\u2019t believe that poll. But we are going to win. And I\u2019ll tell you what. Honestly, Iowa is so important to me. I could say, \"Oh, let\u2019s not do\" \u2013 I am an evangelical. I am a Christian. I\u2019m a Presbyterian. I\u2019m a Presbyterian. I love Billy Graham. Franklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements. Franklin Graham. He was so incredible. He came out \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump...He was so incredible. Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there\u2019s nobody, nobody that I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 Billy Graham was unbelievable. If anybody\u2019s gone to his crusades, they were incredible. But so I think we\u2019re going to do \u2013 we\u2019re doing really well with the evangelicals... And by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness. It\u2019s true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless. I think we\u2019re going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. We\u2019re doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party. And we\u2019re doing fantastic with all the young and middle. We\u2019re doing great with everybody. And so it\u2019s very important for me to win Iowa.

That\u2019s why we\u2019re here all the time. And then the lies happened. You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much.

So let me just before we talk some questions, I\u2019m going to talk about something I\u2019ve never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It\u2019s called Super PACs. It\u2019s one of the great scams of all time. It\u2019s one of the great scams. So we sent out \u2013 I think I had \u2013 and it\u2019s not me. People set them up. And I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019re setting up for my benefit. Let\u2019s take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don\u2019t talk to him. I don\u2019t do anything. I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don\u2019t even know. They\u2019re all over the place. Trump, Trump \u2013 one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book. They have all these PACs. And the money comes in.

Boy, look at the press back there. They must think there\u2019s a big event going happen today. Wow, that\u2019s a lot of them \u2013 it\u2019s like the Academy Awards. But we\u2019ve had an amazing \u2013 it\u2019s been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator. We came down that escalator and it was \u2013 I said, \"Let\u2019s go\" to my wife, who\u2019s been so supportive and so wonderful. I said, \"Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to make America great again. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\" And you know, it\u2019s hard to do this because when you think of it I\u2019ve never done it before. I\u2019ve never been a politician. Thank goodness but I\u2019ve never been a politician. I\u2019ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work. Tens of thousands of people over the years. And you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me. The Nevada poll just came out where I\u2019m leading with Hispanics, which I knew, I knew. And we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said I\u2019m going to run for president I gave up a lot. You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice. That\u2019s hard to do. You have a top show and you say, \"I\u2019m not doing it anymore. I\u2019m sorry.\" They wanted to do it so badly. And Steve Burke, who\u2019s a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said \"Come on, Donald. Come on. Do it. You\u2019re not going to run. Do it. Do it.\" I said, \"Steve, I\u2019m going to run.\" I was pretty sure. You know, that was about two months before. I was pretty sure. It really is a tough thing to do. You know, all my life I\u2019ve heard \"If you\u2019re a very successful person, you\u2019ll never run for president. You\u2019ll never really run for politics. But you\u2019ll never ever run for president.\" And I built a great company and it\u2019s a tremendous number. You saw the filings. The press was going to look so closely. It was like D-Day when we put those papers in. You know, first thing I did I announced. They said, \"Oh, he\u2019s actually going to do it\" because most of them said \"He\u2019ll never do it.\" Then when I signed...that\u2019s when you sign your life away. And I signed that. They said, \"Whoa! He signed that. Well, he\u2019ll never file his financials because maybe he\u2019s not as rich as everybody thinks.\"   And I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable \u2013 you didn\u2019t hear a thing about it. Oh boy, were they looking. I mean, were they looking. And almost 100 pages. The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that. And it showed a company that\u2019s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow. You know, the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And it\u2019s great. And the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States. We need that kind of thinking. We need that \u2013 whatever it is. We need a mentality that\u2019s going to \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $19 trillion in debt. It\u2019s going to be up to $21 trillion. You saw that horrible budget. Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that\u2019s going to lift it. And so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and I\u2019ll tell you right now. You know, now that we\u2019re at it. And they came out some brand new ones \u2013 some beauties. And one\u2019s coming out \u2013 I guess a big one\u2019s coming out. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is but it\u2019s got to be pretty good because I see the response. I mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building. Somebody said it\u2019s a barn. This is a very nice barn actually. But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is. And we do have something special in a couple of minutes. To me, it\u2019s really special because it\u2019s a person that I think is a spectacular person. So it\u2019s very special to me. But then the polls came out and some of them \u2013 as an example \u2013 national polls 38% for Trump, 20% for second. I wouldn\u2019t even names. Right", "occurrence": 1}]}, "For every one percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs. America\u2019s \u201cjob creation deficit\u201d due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs \u2013 and that\u2019s just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages. The Transpacific-Partnership is the greatest danger yet. The TPP would be the death blow for American manufacturing. It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own. It would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters. It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets \u2013 while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports. The TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas. The TPP even created a backdoor for China to supply car parts for automobiles made in Mexico. The agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest wage countries on Earth. Not only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence. The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people can\u2019t veto. These commissions are great Hillary Clinton\u2019s Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes. It should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a \u201cleading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u201d. She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the \u201cgold standard\u201d. Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too \u2013 but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed. She will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career. Here\u2019s how it would go: she would make a small token change, declare the pact fixed, and ram it through. That\u2019s why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP \u201cin its current form,\u201d \u2013 ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity. If the media doesn\u2019t believe me, I have a challenge for you. Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form. There is no way to \u201cfix\u201d the TPP. We need bilateral trade deals. We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down. A Trump Administration will change our failed trade policy \u2013 quickly Here are 7 steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs. One: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified. Two: I\u2019m going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers. Three: I\u2019m going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses. Four: I\u2019m going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don\u2019t mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better. If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal. Five: I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the United States will be met with sharply Six: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China\u2019s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules. Seven: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. President Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry. His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45% and his tariff to shield America\u2019s semiconductor industry was 100%. Hillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war. She has it completely backwards. Hillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another \u2013 from NAFTA to China to South Korea. A Trump Administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people. The era of economic surrender will finally be over. A new era of prosperity will finally begin. America will be independent once more. Under a Trump Presidency, the American worker will finally have a President who will protect them and fight for them. We will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens an American job. We will make America the best place in the world to start a business, hire workers, and open a factory. This includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses. We will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity. Many people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world. We are also going to fully capture America\u2019s tremendous energy capacity. This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines. A Trump Administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure. Just like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State building. It will be American steel that will fortify American\u2019s crumbling bridges. It will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky. It will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities. It will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy \u2013 mined from American resources \u2013 that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. We are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America First again. We are going to make America wealthy again. We are going to reject Hillary Clinton\u2019s politics of fear, futility, and incompetence. We are going to embrace the possibilities of change. It is time to believe in the future. It is time to believe in each other. It is time to Believe In America. This Is How We Are Going To Make America Great Again \u2013 For All Americans. We Are Going To Make America Great Again For Everyone \u2013 Greater Than Ever Before. Thank you.": {"in_response_to": [{"text": "BECAUSE WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A LOT -- LOOK AT THAT.

I\u2019d like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us. Today, I am going to talk about how to Make America Wealthy Again. We are thirty miles from Steel City. Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation. The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape. But our workers\u2019 loyalty was repaid with betrayal. Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization \u2013 moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache. When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing. For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment. Many of these areas have still never recovered. Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families. Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away. Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair. This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can turn it all around \u2013 and we can turn it around fast. But if we\u2019re going to deliver real change, we\u2019re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties. The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything \u2013 and say anything \u2013 to keep things exactly as they are. The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change. The inner cities will remain poor. The factories will remain closed. The borders will remain open. The special interests will remain firmly in control. Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small \u2013 and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future. READ: How Donald Trump Says He\u2019d Win America\u2019s Trade War Top U.S. Labor Leader Blasts Donald Trump in Dueling Speeches My campaign has the opposite message. I want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again. I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who\u2019ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another. Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders. I was on the right side of that issue \u2013 with the people \u2013 while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong. Now it\u2019s time for the American people to take back their future. That\u2019s the choice we face. We can either give in to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign of fear, or we can choose to Believe In America. We lost our way when we stopped believing in our country. America became the world\u2019s dominant economy by becoming the world\u2019s dominant producer. The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known. But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America, to promoting development in other nations. We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable. Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result. I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years. Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export. This is not some natural disaster. It is politician-made disaster. It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism. This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free. Our Founding Fathers Understood Trade George Washington said that \u201cthe promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.\u201d Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the \u201cexpediency of encouraging manufactur[ing] in the United States.\u201d The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that: \u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government\u2026 must produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs \u2013 emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production. Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down. We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free. As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before. Ladies and Gentlemen, it\u2019s time to declare our economic independence once again. That means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years. America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 \u2013 even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people. At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Second, China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. NAFTA was the worst trade deal in history, and China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history. It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it. It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China\u2019s disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible agreement. Then, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property. The city of Pittsburgh, and the State of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO. Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time. Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China. It was also Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012. As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs. As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton \u201cVoted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.\u201d Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back. To understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper. Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our Gross Domestic Product. From 1947 to 2001 \u2013 a span of over five decades \u2013 our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%. However, since 2002 \u2013 the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports \u2013 that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.

The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media \u2013 these people back here. They\u2019re the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they\u2019re so dishonest. They are so dishonest. I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right \u2019tis the end. I had one of the politicians \u2013 Kasich \u2013 who is just getting \u2013 he\u2019s a horrible debater\u2026He made a statement that \"Oh, they left after 10 minutes.\" Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody\u2019s leaving. Nobody\u2019s leaving here except for the one person that was screaming. So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s not their thing to do. You know, we get the biggest crowds. They don\u2019t want to show this crowd tonight. They\u2019re not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don\u2019t do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show \u2013 look at all the people over here. It\u2019s a record in the history of this ship. But they don\u2019t show it. They don\u2019t show it. No, no. And I say fan it and they never ever fan it. I say fan the crowd and they never fan it. And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It\u2019s disgusting. Disgusting. \u2026And by the way, some of the media\u2019s terrific but most of it 70%, 75% is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. They\u2019re totally dishonest people.   I had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said \"Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early.\" I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes. I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false. Amazingly, there\u2019s a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She\u2019s back there. Little Katie. She\u2019s back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie \u2013 Katie Tur \u2013 what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie. And they did a story where they \u2013 I didn\u2019t know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media. And they said it was a total lie. And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. And then other people pick it up. You know it\u2019s NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate.

If it\u2019s windy, if it\u2019s hot \u2013 everything is extreme. So now they use extreme weather. It is a disgrace what\u2019s going on. And to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.     \u2026It\u2019s a great honor. I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I\u2019ve heard about Simon and Schuster\u2019s being a fabulous \u2013 I was going to say the Rolls-Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You\u2019ve given us such tremendous support. And we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It\u2019s been an incredible experience. We wrote a book and the title \u2013 \"Crippled America\" \u2013 is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we\u2019ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth. And America is crippled. We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now it\u2019s actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt. We have a military that doesn\u2019t have proper instruction from leadership. We don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re losing all over the world with trade deals. Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they\u2019re beating us in trade. And we can\u2019t go on like this any longer. It\u2019s impossible to go on like this any longer. I always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s going to work anymore. So we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it\u2019s going to be very instructional, very important. To me, it was instructional. When I did \"The Art of the Deal\", I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book \"The Art of the Deal\" and the other books we\u2019ve done. So this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what\u2019s going on right now. It\u2019s a moment of time. And we got it done. And David did a fantastic job\u2026And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in.   But we see by the lines \u2013 the lines go down to Park Avenue. They\u2019ve been forming since last night and I\u2019m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. We\u2019re doing a couple of interviews and then we\u2019re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that\u2019ll be very exciting for me. But we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing this but they do it. They find a way. So I\u2019m looking forward to getting to the signings. \u2026       Well, I think it\u2019s a different book. You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where I\u2019m leading. You saw the new poll from Iowa. You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where I\u2019m leading big. A poll just came out in Florida where I\u2019m leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place. And I think you know look we\u2019re doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we\u2019re beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we\u2019re beating \u2013 they call it the establishment. It\u2019s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down. But I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how his book is doing.       Well, I think my book is very hard-hitting. His is a different kind of book and he\u2019s a different kind of a person. My book is very hard-hitting. It says it like it is. And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, it\u2019s selling like hotcakes. So we\u2019ll see.       We\u2019re very different people. We have very different qualities and we are extremely different. And I\u2019m different from all of the other candidates. Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me. We are going to take the $400 billion a year that we\u2019re losing with China, that\u2019s going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we\u2019re short on with Japan. The $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that\u2019s right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally. So I mean, much different than \u2013 you\u2019re look at Marco Rubio \u2013 very, very weak on illegal immigration. You look at Ben and he\u2019s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can\u2019t get rid of Medicare. It\u2019d be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don\u2019t know how he stays here.       No, I think that really Marco is over-rated. And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message. I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn\u2019t been able to \u2013 Marco doesn\u2019t show up to the United States Senate. He\u2019s representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and I\u2019m way up in Florida over everybody. But Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn\u2019t show up for the people of Florida, and I don\u2019t think he should be doing that. Now, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush\u2019s side and ultimately I think Marco\u2019s going to be hurt very badly. And if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he\u2019s coming from, I think people are going to say, \"Whoa, we didn\u2019t know that.\" But look at Marco\u2019s stance on illegal immigration. It\u2019s really trouble for him. I don\u2019t see how he can win.       Marco Rubio\u2019s personal finances are discredit\u2026All you have to do is look at his credit card. I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I love Florida. I\u2019m in Florida all the time. And for years, I\u2019ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster. I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that. But his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I\u2019ve heard about it for years. You\u2019ll have to find out.       Well, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his \u2013 you know, he certainly lives above his means. There\u2019s no question about that.   \u2026I\u2019ll tell you what. On the debates, it\u2019s very interesting. Because I don\u2019t really care that much. I want a room. I want a podium. And let\u2019s get going. Because I don\u2019t really care that much. But a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect \u2013 many of them, not all of them \u2013 but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls. I mean, she wasn\u2019t asked one tough question. They didn\u2019t talk about her foundation. They didn\u2019t talk about any of the problems. They didn\u2019t talk about the emails. When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign. I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint. In order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails. That was end of his campaign. First of all, people aren\u2019t going to his rallies anymore. He\u2019s finished. So unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she\u2019ll easily be the candidate. But I will say this: She only got softballs. That\u2019s all she got. And if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn\u2019t the same way. With that being said, I don\u2019t really care.       Well, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall. They coalesced at that last debate because I mean, it really started with me. The guy asked me a question. I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter. He\u2019s a disaster. And he was \u2013 it was such as horribly put question and so obvious. And the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it. And all we want to do is to be treated fairly. But with me, I don\u2019t care that much. Just give me a podium. What I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else. You know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn\u2019t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched.

Our country spends our money so stupidly and I will tell you that I could speak for myself I pay a lot of tax but I fight like hell to make it as low as possible. But I would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that I respected the decisions.

It\u2019s such a phony number. Because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, they\u2019re taken off the roll. So the number isn\u2019t reflective.

But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States. You know, it used to be they\u2019d move from New York to Florida. They\u2019d move from New Jersey to Texas. Or whatever. Now, they\u2019re talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better. And they\u2019re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons \u2013 one of the big reasons \u2013 as you know is taxes. One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they\u2019ve built up and they can\u2019t get back into our country.

I actually think it\u2019s going to be more money than that. And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.

I have great respect for China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders. Our leaders don\u2019t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much. No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit. It won\u2019t be that way for long.

I mean, right now, they\u2019re projected I guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states. It\u2019s Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts \u2014 (CHEERS) \u2014 Tennessee, Virginia. And you know, these are amazing states and we\u2019re going to probably get a lot more. In fact, we\u2019re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers. But I will say this. Look, we have expanded the Republican Party. When you look at what\u2019s happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in. They came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and they\u2019re Democrats and they\u2019re long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. And they were independents. And we\u2019ve actually expanded the party. Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example. Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes. We doubled it. We were almost 800,000. Whereas the Democrats went down. There\u2019s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats. So I \u2014 look, I\u2019m a unifier. I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unifier. Once we get all of this finished, I\u2019m going to go after one person, that\u2019s Hillary Clinton, on the assumption she\u2019s allowed to run, which is a big assumption. I don\u2019t know that she\u2019s going to be allowed to run. And I think that\u2019s, frankly, going to be an easy race. You see the polls. I beat Hillary in many polls. I know one thing. I don\u2019t think Marco is going to be able to beat her. I don\u2019t think \u2014 in all fairness, I think Ted\u2019s going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he\u2019s won a little bit. So I just tell you this. We are going to be a much finer party, a much \u2014 we\u2019re going to be a unified party, I mean, to be honest with you. And we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening. We\u2019re going to be a much bigger party. Our party is expanding. And all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where I\u2019ve won and just look \u2014 we\u2019ve gone from X number to a much larger number. That hasn\u2019t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades. So I think we\u2019re going to be more inclusive. I think we\u2019re going to be more unified and I think we\u2019re going to be a much bigger party, and I think we\u2019re going to win in November.

They really have been very fair.       No, I have no intention of changing my mind.       Well, I think the big thing that\u2019s changed is \u2013 and it\u2019s been obvious to all \u2013 number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship. Nobody thought I was going to run and they said \"Oh, he won\u2019t run and he won\u2019t put in his papers. And he wouldn\u2019t do all of this.\" I did that. The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular. It\u2019s a great company. I built a great company. And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received. And I think the thing that\u2019s changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that I\u2019d be running for President. So I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect. So that was very important.       No, I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.       Well, you don\u2019t have to be met when you\u2019re at 2%. It\u2019s one of those things. That\u2019s the way life works. And I like Gov. [Chris] Christie, by the way.       Well, the Chairman asked if he could come up. You saw him. He was here a little while ago. And I was greatly honored that he did come up frankly.       Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we\u2019re a nation that speaks English and I think that while we\u2019re in this nation, we should be speaking English. And that\u2019s how assimilation takes. And that\u2019s how \u2013 I mean, whether people like it or not that\u2019s how we assimilate and that\u2019s how we go on to that next phase and that next stage. And that\u2019s how people that don\u2019t speak \u2013 and I\u2019m not just talking about Spanish; I\u2019m talking about from various parts of the world \u2013 that\u2019s how they will become successful and do great. So I think it\u2019s more appropriate to be speaking English.         Well, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly it\u2019s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws. And when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that. And this is not from South America. This is not from Mexico. This is from all over the world. When people come illegally, we cannot allow that. And I want people to come legally. I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess. That\u2019s been proven. And interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I\u2019ve been proven right. And many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate. Of course, they haven\u2019t done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will. The fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders. We\u2019re a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws. And we will make sure that that takes place. With that being said, I want people to come into our country legally. I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door. I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley. I want engineers. I want physicists. I want people with great talent to come into the United States. When people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford. And immediately if you\u2019re not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country. We want those people to stay. We want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen.       I don\u2019t know enough about it to comment on it.

I don\u2019t really think \u2013 look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally. I was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13. I ended up coming in second. Didn\u2019t devote tremendous time to it. Didn\u2019t devote tremendous money to it. In fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, I\u2019m about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient. I came in second. I came into strong second. Third, I think, was quite a bit away \u2013 I think 2,500 or something \u2013 close to 3,000 votes away. There\u2019s a big difference between second and third. I think we did really well. You know, as far as that\u2019s concerned. I think the press \u2013 some of the press said I did fantastically well. Some of the press doesn\u2019t want to give it credit. I think we did very well. I didn\u2019t expect to do so well. I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said I\u2019m 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people. But it had taken me back to June 16th. I was told \"Don\u2019t even go to Iowa. Start right here in New Hampshire. Just don\u2019t waste your \u2013 \" ...I\u2019m going to Iowa. I went. I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals. We did really fantastically and came very close to winning. I mean, we came very close to winning. We came in second place. So I am very happy with what happened in Iowa. You know, you had 17 people and I was second. Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second. And I think we did a very good job.   No, I don\u2019t think I feel any pressure. I mean, we\u2019re going to just do what I have to do. And if it works out, that\u2019s great. And if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s okay too because you know I\u2019m here to do one thing \u2013 the theme \u2013 make America great again. I\u2019m going to do it. And I think we did very well \u2013 I think we did really well in just about everything we\u2019ve done running for office. I think we have a very good result yesterday.

Well, I think the big thing that\u2019s changed is \u2013 and it\u2019s been obvious to all \u2013 number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship.

So I think it\u2019s more appropriate to be speaking English.         Well, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly it\u2019s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws. And when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that. And this is not from South America. This is not from Mexico. This is from all over the world. When people come illegally, we cannot allow that. And I want people to come legally. I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess. That\u2019s been proven. And interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I\u2019ve been proven right. And many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate. Of course, they haven\u2019t done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will. The fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders. We\u2019re a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws. And we will make sure that that takes place. With that being said, I want people to come into our country legally. I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door. I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley. I want engineers.

They don\u2019t have it. Believe me, they don\u2019t have it. It\u2019s just going to be more of the same. So, we are going to make our country so great. We are going to make it strong. We are going to make it powerful. We\u2019re going to rebuild the military. We\u2019re going to make it so strong. We are going to take care of our veterans. And in the end, in the end, I want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day. The other week \u2013 two weeks ago in Mobile, Alabama, 31,000 people showed up in a rainy rough day. 31,000 people came to see us speak and we\u2019re talking about making America great again. Last night in Dallas at the American Airlines Center, 20,000 people \u2013 the basketball arena of the Mavericks. 20,000 people showed up and I want to tell you, it was a love fest. Everybody \u2013 think of it, 20,000 people \u2013 there wasn\u2019t one heckler in the whole room. I kept saying, \"There\u2019s got to be one.\" There was a word \u2013 two words that used to be used a lot called \"silent majority\". They stopped using them. The silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different. I don\u2019t think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they\u2019re not silent. People are not silent. They\u2019re disgusted with our incompetent politicians. They\u2019re disgusted with the people that are giving our country away. They\u2019re disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job. They\u2019re disgusted when they\u2019re allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they\u2019re standing there helpless and people just pour into the country. They\u2019re disgusted when a woman who\u2019s nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years. They\u2019re disgusted by what\u2019s happening to our country. And you\u2019re going to look around and you\u2019re going to remember who the people are that are here because we\u2019re doing something special. This is a movement. We\u2019re going to make our country great again. Believe me, we will make our country great again. I love you all. Thank you very much.   Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor. The Chairman just left as you probably know and he\u2019s been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period. And as you know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted. I wanted fairness. I don\u2019t have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party. We\u2019re leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we\u2019re over 30%. We\u2019ve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%. And frankly, I\u2019ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it\u2019s Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what\u2019s happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up. And for that reason, I have signed the pledge. So I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win. And most importantly, we will make our country great again because that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. We have to make our country great again.       This is a self-funded campaign. We have our heart in it. We have our soul in it. I don\u2019t need money and I don\u2019t want money. And this is going to be a campaign like I think no other. I\u2019m not controlled by lobbyists. I\u2019m not controlled by anybody. I\u2019m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again.       Yeah, I got nothing. I really got nothing.

Well, it\u2019s a good question and you can connect the dots. But I guess it has been probably since \u201904. You know, you\u2019re talking about 10, 11, 12 years that people have wanted to bring the money back into the country. And again it\u2019s called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they\u2019re going to other countries, taking jobs. And now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies \u2013 very large, very prestigious companies as you know \u2013 obviously you know something about business. But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States. You know, it used to be they\u2019d move from New York to Florida. They\u2019d move from New Jersey to Texas. Or whatever. Now, they\u2019re talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better. And they\u2019re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons \u2013 one of the big reasons \u2013 as you know is taxes. One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they\u2019ve built up and they can\u2019t get back into our country. And when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, it\u2019s going to be put to work in our country, largely. It can go other places. But largely. And I think it will be an amazing boon. Now, here\u2019s the other thing. They think it\u2019s $2.5 trillion. I think it\u2019s much more than that. I actually think it\u2019s going to be more money than that. And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.         Well, you know when you end the repatriation, when you get the money coming back in beyond, tremendous things happen.       Well, I\u2019ll be announcing that in the not too distant future. But I will tell you. I\u2019ve been honest. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s honest about this thing. I watched Romney. I watched all \u2013 \"Oh, I pay so much tax. I pay so much tax.\" I watched all politicians and they say \"I pay \u2013 \" I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.

No, we\u2019re lowering taxes very substantially. We\u2019re simplifying. And we\u2019re getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons.

Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.   In fact, Clinton's State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.   Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.   This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.   We can't let this happen.   Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.   The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.   The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.   The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.

After years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned \u2013 we can\u2019t fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently. We can\u2019t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems. The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. They\u2019ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars. Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. Something about how she\u2019s getting away with this folks nobody understands. Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a President in a corrupt system is totally protecting her \u2013 not right. I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we\u2019re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. I think you\u2019re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows. Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund \u2013 the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese \u2013 all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. It\u2019s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens. I didn\u2019t need to do this. It\u2019s not easy, believe me. I didn\u2019t need to do it. But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family. I\u2019ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people\u2019s eyes. I\u2019ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it\u2019s horrible. I\u2019ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn\u2019t have been in the country \u2013 remember it, folks, remember it. I visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools. I\u2019ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and I\u2019ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it\u2019s really not to be believed, hard to imagine what\u2019s happened to our country. America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder. We\u2019re broke, we\u2019re broke. We owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared. The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster. What a crowd, what a crowd. Thank you all very much. We love our country, we love our country. But we can turn this all around. We\u2019re going to do it by putting America first. That commitment is the foundation for change that\u2019s been missing and it\u2019s been missing for a long time. It\u2019s important to understand what America First means. It means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. It has to make us safer as a nation. This is the opposite of Hillary\u2019s foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks. We have made them that way. You better hope I\u2019m President. On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition. What\u2019s happening there is absolutely a disgrace. No PPP, you\u2019re right about that and you mean no PP. We are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, OK. We are only going to have that. We\u2019re not going to approve, as somebody just said, the TransPacific Partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular Mexico. If it\u2019s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. It\u2019s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we\u2019re suffering bigly and it\u2019s getting worse. On energy policy, America First means opening up America\u2019s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this Administration. On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and business; likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level. We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country. On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or tenth generation. No matter who you are, we\u2019re going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\u2019re babies. The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together. Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; it\u2019s got to be that way. Now, the people in charge say things can\u2019t change. I\u2019m here today to tell you that we have to change. We have no choice. We have to change. We\u2019re going to put America back to work. We\u2019re going to make our own products. We\u2019re going to put America back to work. We\u2019re going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad. We\u2019re going to take care of our African American people that have been mistreated for so long. We\u2019re going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again. Together, we will put the American people first again, first again. We will make our communities wealthy. We will make our cities safe again. We will make our country strong again. Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again, remember. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.   Thank you for joining me today.   This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.   Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.   There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.   But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.   The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country\u2019s history.   So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.   The horror is beyond description.   The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.   We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.   We mourn, as one people, for our nation\u2019s loss \u2013 and pledge our support to any and all who need it.   I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.   [SILENCE]   Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.   This is a very dark moment in America\u2019s history.   A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.   It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.   It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.   It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.   We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people \u2013 with force, purpose and determination.   But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.   If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart \u2013 and fast \u2013 we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.   The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don\u2019t share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.   The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.   That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.   We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.   We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.   With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.   I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.   The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.   I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.   After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.   We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.   Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.   Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.   I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence. It\u2019s not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.   If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \u2013 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people \u2013 then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.   We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.   We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.   Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.   All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.   Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.   The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.   The male shooter in San Bernardino \u2013 again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife \u2013 the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.   Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.   We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.   If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.   Yet, Hillary Clinton \u2013 for months and despite so many attacks \u2013 repeatedly refused to even say the words \"radical Islam,\" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.   However, Hillary Clinton \u2013 who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage \u2013 still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won\u2019t speak honestly about what it is.   She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.   In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\"   Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans\u2019 guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.   I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.   The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.   In fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.   When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss \u2013 it's deadly.   The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.   I refuse to be politically correct.   I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.   The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.   As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.   We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials \u2013 and with our allies.   I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism \u2013 and who will have the support they require to get the job done.   We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.   The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.   Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.   These Departments refused to comply.   President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.   The public has a right to know how these people got here.   We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.   We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.   Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups", "occurrence": 1}]}, "Look, we\u2019re losing our jobs. Look at your jobs.

The networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans. That\u2019s what I want.       I\u2019m giving them away.

And they get paid a lot of money \u2013 in many cases more than men doing the same job. So women have always appreciated that about me.

Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana. It's also rated AAA, their bonds are rated AAA. Very few states have that. AAA. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, AAA. Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana. And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor. Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind.

People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on \u2014 they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal. Take a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with \u2014 you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got them jobs. Got them jobs. Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy. Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K- 12 education funding increase in the state's history.

Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen, when he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them.

We\u2019re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they\u2019re working. Then the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs. I have some people that I know very well and they\u2019ve had a job for 20 years at the same place. All of a sudden they\u2019re working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better. They love the owners, the stores and things. They love the owners; they think the owners are great. But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs. They work all their life. They have a wonderful company that they\u2019re working for, and now all of a sudden they\u2019re cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare.

But we have some of the top people in the country worked on this.       Well, we\u2019re looking at a 3% but we think it can be 5%, it could even be 6%. We\u2019re going to have growth that will be tremendous. And by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular. And one of the things that they don\u2019t take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting. There is so much waste in government and I believe when I get in there I\u2019ll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the \u2013 and we\u2019re not even showing anything for that. So, they\u2019re very conservative numbers.       My taxes will \u2013 first of all, I\u2019ll have a much simpler tax statement. It will be much simpler. When I do my return, it will be much \u2013 my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous. And you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else. We want to simplify them to a tremendous level. The bracket of 25% \u2013 the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all \u2013 they\u2019ve been there for years \u2013 are antiquated in many cases. Or are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to Hillary, they\u2019re contributing to Bush. They\u2019re contributing to every candidate but Trump. Because I\u2019m not taking any money. I\u2019m self-funding. And these people want these deductions. There will be people \u2013 we\u2019re reducing taxes. But believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that won\u2019t be thrilled with this. We\u2019re taking away deductions and that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re able to lower it.       This is actually a tax reduction. A big tax reduction, including for the upper income. I believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won\u2019t be getting certain deductions which aren\u2019t fair for them to be getting that they\u2019ll end up doing better.       I just think this is a common sense approach. You know, we could say supply side. You could say there\u2019s 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s supply side or anything else. I think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that\u2019s going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work. It\u2019s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs. One of the other things that I\u2019m coupling this with is if I become President, I\u2019m going to renegotiate our trade deals. Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country. Not sustainable. We cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries. There\u2019s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn\u2019t make a better deal. Everybody. We lose money with everything. I\u2019m also going to renegotiate some of our military costs. Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 we protect everybody. We protect everybody. And we don\u2019t get reimbursement. We lose on everything. We lose on everything. So, we\u2019re going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that\u2019s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly. I\u2019m not showing a big number in that. But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive. As an example, Saudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. We protect them. So we need help. We\u2019re losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion. I used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now it\u2019s $19 trillion and it\u2019s only going up.       Well, no, look. Senator [Marco] Rubio is a lightweight. We understand that. He wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. He wouldn\u2019t know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is they\u2019re trying to take \u2013 we just went up in the last poll.

Ask the people that support him.

We will someday in the not so distant future if I win \u2013 otherwise it\u2019s not going to happen I have to be honest with you. But Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam and all of \u2013 And we\u2019re not going to be losing our companies. You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether it\u2019s Carrier air conditioning, whether it\u2019s Ford, whether it\u2019s Eaton. I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp. they\u2019re leaving and so many companies are leaving. And frankly, I\u2019m disgusted with it and I\u2019m tired of seeing it and there\u2019s no reason for it. It\u2019s just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen. Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, they\u2019re going to Ireland. And there\u2019s so many more. You have corporate inversions. You have people who can\u2019t get their money back into the country because the politicians can\u2019t get along. They can\u2019t make a deal. Everybody agrees \u2013 Democrat and Republican \u2013 everybody agrees the money should come back...trillion dollars outside of this country. Everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven\u2019t been able to make a deal. And we could make a deal. There\u2019s an example of something that you could do if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you\u2019re doing because everybody wants to do it. And companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which we\u2019re going to lower by the way. But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that\u2019s their money because there\u2019s no way of bringing it in. So, we\u2019ve got a long way to go. But I think at some point it\u2019s going to get done. This has been very exciting, this whole process. We started, I was one of 17 people \u2013 senators, governors. I\u2019ve had such great support. Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us. Great guy. Great guy. Wonderful man. And Chris Christie endorsed us. That was so incredible. And today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us. She was great. She is a truly wonderful woman, of the job she\u2019s done in Florida is incredible. You know, so many \u2013 we\u2019ve had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day \u2013 tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation. The fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together. We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody\u2019s writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they\u2019re talking about it. Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many, many more people. I\u2019m looking at the polling booths. I\u2019m looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it\u2019s up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman \u2013 one woman was there for 40 years. She\u2019s been working the polls. And she said, \"We\u2019d have two people here. We\u2019d have three people. Now look at the line.\" And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep and long. And it\u2019s just a different thing. We have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before. It\u2019s an incredible thing.   I want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarah\u2019s husband. Sarah was here. She was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her. And what happened is he was in a very bad accident. He\u2019s tough as nails. He\u2019s going to be fine.

I\u2019d like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us. Today, I am going to talk about how to Make America Wealthy Again. We are thirty miles from Steel City. Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation. The legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape. But our workers\u2019 loyalty was repaid with betrayal. Our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization \u2013 moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas. Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache. When subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing. For years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment. Many of these areas have still never recovered. Our politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families. Skilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away. Many Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair. This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. We can turn it all around \u2013 and we can turn it around fast. But if we\u2019re going to deliver real change, we\u2019re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties. The people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything \u2013 and say anything \u2013 to keep things exactly as they are. The people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change. The inner cities will remain poor. The factories will remain closed. The borders will remain open. The special interests will remain firmly in control. Hillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small \u2013 and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future. READ: How Donald Trump Says He\u2019d Win America\u2019s Trade War Top U.S. Labor Leader Blasts Donald Trump in Dueling Speeches My campaign has the opposite message. I want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again. I want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who\u2019ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another. Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders. I was on the right side of that issue \u2013 with the people \u2013 while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong. Now it\u2019s time for the American people to take back their future. That\u2019s the choice we face. We can either give in to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign of fear, or we can choose to Believe In America. We lost our way when we stopped believing in our country. America became the world\u2019s dominant economy by becoming the world\u2019s dominant producer. The wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known. But then America changed its policy from promoting development in America, to promoting development in other nations. We allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable. Trillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result. I have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years. Today, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export. This is not some natural disaster. It is politician-made disaster. It is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism. This is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free. Our Founding Fathers Understood Trade George Washington said that \u201cthe promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.\u201d Alexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the \u201cexpediency of encouraging manufactur[ing] in the United States.\u201d The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that: \u201cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government\u2026 must produce want and ruin among our people.\u201d Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs \u2013 emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production. Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down. We tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free. As a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before. Ladies and Gentlemen, it\u2019s time to declare our economic independence once again. That means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years. America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 \u2013 even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people. At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton. First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Second, China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization. NAFTA was the worst trade deal in history, and China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history. It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it. It was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China\u2019s disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible agreement. Then, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property. The city of Pittsburgh, and the State of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO. Fifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time. Almost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China. It was also Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012. As reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs. As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton \u201cVoted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.\u201d Trade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back. To understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper. Massive trade deficits subtract directly from our Gross Domestic Product. From 1947 to 2001 \u2013 a span of over five decades \u2013 our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%. However, since 2002 \u2013 the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports \u2013 that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.

I think people are going to be very happy. We\u2019ve already had some very good reviews.

So good luck everybody. Thank you very much. I love you. I love you. Thank you. And we\u2019ll be back. Thank you.   So, we\u2019re going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again. It\u2019s a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again. Too few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet. This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business. It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction. It will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn\u2019t seen for decades. And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit. But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we\u2019ve got to make our economy strong. Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven\u2019t seen in a long time. We\u2019re going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. If you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 \u2013 so, very important. If you\u2019re single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you\u2019ll not pay any income tax \u2013 nothing. This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty. It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax. It ends the death tax. It\u2019s a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax. It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true \u2013 while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly. It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest. So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital. Changes for business \u2013 now, so important, because it\u2019s all about business. It\u2019s all about jobs. We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can\u2019t work. So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction. A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount \u2013 10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Now, it\u2019s called corporate inversion. It\u2019s a huge subject. I\u2019ve been watching politicians now for years \u2013 all talk, no action politicians. I\u2019ve been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back.   The number is probably $2.5 trillion. Everybody agrees it should come back \u2013 Republicans, Democrats, everybody. They can\u2019t make a deal. They don\u2019t know how to go about making a deal. The reason companies aren\u2019t bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn\u2019t make sense to bring it back. And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They\u2019re leaving our shores to go and collect their money. They\u2019re going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons \u2013 the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can\u2019t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in. It\u2019s called leadership. We will have that money brought back in. As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can\u2019t bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We\u2019ve been doing this for a year and a half. We can\u2019t get it back in. So the money stays in other countries and that\u2019s what happens. Not good for us. The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something \u2013 and I\u2019ve been watching it for a long time \u2013 everybody agrees to. We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes \u2013 many of them actually \u2013 and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income. The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don\u2019t make sense, and which are unfair are gone. And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense. So we are going to give you \u2013 we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we\u2019re going to hand them out right now to the press. And I think you\u2019ll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair. It\u2019s graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more. Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer. But I actually believe they\u2019ll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we\u2019ll have something very special. Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what\u2019s going on in this country.

I\u2019m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I\u2019m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.   Number one, the people negotiating don\u2019t have a clue. Our president doesn\u2019t have a clue. He\u2019s a bad negotiator.   He\u2019s the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.   We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That\u2019s the negotiator we have.   Take a look at the deal he\u2019s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won\u2019t exist very long. It\u2019s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But... So we need people \u2014 I\u2019m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don\u2019t have talented people, if you don\u2019t have great leadership, if you don\u2019t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.   Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren\u2019t smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it\u2019s just not going to work.   So, here\u2019s a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.   But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything \u2014 everything, they got away with it again. And it\u2019s impossible for our people here to compete.

After years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned \u2013 we can\u2019t fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently. We can\u2019t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems. The Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. They\u2019ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars. Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. Something about how she\u2019s getting away with this folks nobody understands. Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a President in a corrupt system is totally protecting her \u2013 not right. I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we\u2019re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. I think you\u2019re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows. Hillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund \u2013 the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese \u2013 all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. It\u2019s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens. I didn\u2019t need to do this. It\u2019s not easy, believe me. I didn\u2019t need to do it. But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family. I\u2019ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people\u2019s eyes. I\u2019ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it\u2019s horrible. I\u2019ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn\u2019t have been in the country \u2013 remember it, folks, remember it. I visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools. I\u2019ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and I\u2019ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it\u2019s really not to be believed, hard to imagine what\u2019s happened to our country. America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder. We\u2019re broke, we\u2019re broke. We owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared. The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster. What a crowd, what a crowd. Thank you all very much. We love our country, we love our country. But we can turn this all around. We\u2019re going to do it by putting America first. That commitment is the foundation for change that\u2019s been missing and it\u2019s been missing for a long time. It\u2019s important to understand what America First means. It means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. It has to make us safer as a nation. This is the opposite of Hillary\u2019s foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks. We have made them that way. You better hope I\u2019m President. On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition. What\u2019s happening there is absolutely a disgrace. No PPP, you\u2019re right about that and you mean no PP. We are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, OK. We are only going to have that. We\u2019re not going to approve, as somebody just said, the TransPacific Partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular Mexico. If it\u2019s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. It\u2019s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we\u2019re suffering bigly and it\u2019s getting worse. On energy policy, America First means opening up America\u2019s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this Administration. On economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and business; likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level. We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country. On immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or tenth generation. No matter who you are, we\u2019re going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\u2019re babies. The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together. Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; it\u2019s got to be that way. Now, the people in charge say things can\u2019t change. I\u2019m here today to tell you that we have to change. We have no choice. We have to change. We\u2019re going to put America back to work. We\u2019re going to make our own products. We\u2019re going to put America back to work. We\u2019re going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad. We\u2019re going to take care of our African American people that have been mistreated for so long. We\u2019re going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again. Together, we will put the American people first again, first again. We will make our communities wealthy. We will make our cities safe again. We will make our country strong again. Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again, remember. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.   Thank you for joining me today.   This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.   Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.   There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.   But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.   The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country\u2019s history.   So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.   The horror is beyond description.   The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.   We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.   We mourn, as one people, for our nation\u2019s loss \u2013 and pledge our support to any and all who need it.   I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.   [SILENCE]   Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando's LGBT Community.   This is a very dark moment in America\u2019s history.   A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.   It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.   It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.   It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.   We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people \u2013 with force, purpose and determination.   But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.   If we don't get tough, and we don't get smart \u2013 and fast \u2013 we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.   The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don\u2019t share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.   The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.   That is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.   We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.   We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.   With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.   I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.   The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.   I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.   After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.   We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.   Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.   Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.   I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence. It\u2019s not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.   If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \u2013 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people \u2013 then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.   We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.   We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.   Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.   All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.   Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.   The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.   The male shooter in San Bernardino \u2013 again, whose name I won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife \u2013 the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.   Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.   We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.   If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.   Yet, Hillary Clinton \u2013 for months and despite so many attacks \u2013 repeatedly refused to even say the words \"radical Islam,\" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.   However, Hillary Clinton \u2013 who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage \u2013 still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won\u2019t speak honestly about what it is.   She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.   In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\"   Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans\u2019 guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.   I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.   The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.   In fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.   When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss \u2013 it's deadly.   The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.   I refuse to be politically correct.   I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.   The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.   As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.   We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials \u2013 and with our allies.   I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism \u2013 and who will have the support they require to get the job done.   We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.   The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.   Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama's Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.   These Departments refused to comply.   President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.   The public has a right to know how these people got here.   We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.   We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.   Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups": {"in_response_to": [{"text": "That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing, folks.

Beautiful.  Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I\u2019d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace. It\u2019s time to shake the rust off America\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be. That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of. In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall. History will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another. They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama\u2019s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy. We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment. They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy. First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He\u2019s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year. We\u2019re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem. I\u2019m the only one \u2014 believe me, I know them all, I\u2019m the only one who knows how to fix it. Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I\u2019ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so. They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia. The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.  The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.   Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can\u2019t depend on us. We\u2019ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we\u2019ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.     And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.     All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran\u2019s treatment of our ten captured sailors \u2014 so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.   When the other side knows you\u2019re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win \u2014 you just can\u2019t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You\u2019ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.   Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.   President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we\u2019ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.   We\u2019ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they\u2019re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good. Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they\u2019re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don\u2019t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don\u2019t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.   Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It\u2019s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.   Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth \u2014 fourth place": {"in_response_to": [{"text": "They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love.

And then he appointed Justice Roberts.  And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts.  And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes.  So you can't have Jeb Bush.  And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win.  So Mitt and--you just can't have those two.  That's it.  That's it.  It's so simple. So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important.  And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters.  And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet.  He is reading it.  I mean give me a break.  Everything is read.  You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk.  And that's what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.  But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing.  No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that.  But we have to do something about these teleprompters. But in looking at these situations--  I built an incredible company.  And you'll see that.  An incredible company; a wonderful company.  I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing.  And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix.  We have such great potential. So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in: creating jobs; defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists--and you have to do that; reducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it; securing our Southern border--and I mean seriously securing it; stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere; saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it; repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country.

Everybody can be c-- This plan is just a basic disaster.  Nobody knows.

The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, we will, I promise we will. Which brings me to my next point. The utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It\u2019s not a friend to freedom. It\u2019s not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know, it has its home. And it surely is not a friend to Israel. With President Obama in his final year, yay! He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me. Believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear. An agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster. The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president, 100 percent. When people ask why, it\u2019s because that\u2019s not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together. They come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something it values, I mean we have to do something where there\u2019s value in exchange for something that it requires. That\u2019s what a deal is. A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That\u2019s not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It\u2019s not going to happen folks. And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they\u2019re stabbing Israelis, and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenol young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don\u2019t reward behavior like that. You can not do it! There is only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it! So, it\u2019s not up the United Nations to go with a solution. It\u2019s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. You have no choice. They have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don\u2019t even really know what\u2019s happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It\u2019s so preposterous. We\u2019re not going to let that happen. When I\u2019m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. You see, I know about deal-making. That\u2019s what I do. I wrote \u2018The Art of the Deal\u2019. One of the best-selling, all-time, and I mean seriously, I\u2019m saying \u2018one of\u2019, because I\u2019ll be criticized as though I say \u2018the\u2019, so I\u2019m going to be very diplomatic. One of... I\u2019ll be criticized. I think it is number one, but why take a chance. One of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making. To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000, where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous. Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer. The Palestinian Authority rejected it also. Then John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didn\u2019t even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn\u2019t even respond. When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One. And when I say something, I mean it. I mean it. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we\u2019ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and hate the Jews. It has to stop. When you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero\u2019s, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. we can\u2019t let this continue. We can\u2019t let this happen any longer. You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible, horrible way to think. It\u2019s a barrier that can\u2019t be broken. That will end, and it\u2019ll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you\u2019ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they\u2019ve got to go out, and they\u2019ve got to start this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it, and now! There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies. And you see that happening all the time. That pattern practiced by the President and his administration, including former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly. But its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn\u2019t happen. President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it\u2019s precisely the opposite that happened. Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it\u2019s a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We\u2019ll get it solved, one way or the other. We will get it solved. But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially. That\u2019s what will happen when Donald Trump is President of the United States. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish State and it will forever exist as a Jewish State. I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I\u2019ve been with Israel so long in terms of, I\u2019ve received some of my greatest honors from Israel. My father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as I\u2019m concerned. So I want to thank you very much. This has been a truly great honor. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Wow. Thank you very much. Hello. I\u2019d like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey and California. We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers. I\u2019m truly honored by your support. Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we\u2019re only getting started and it\u2019s going to be beautiful, remember that. Tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another. Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes. This is a great feeling. That\u2019s a great feeling. This is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible. You\u2019ve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall. We\u2019re going to do it. We\u2019re going to do it, folks. We\u2019re going to do it. I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down \u2013 too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears. I\u2019m never going to let you down. I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that\u2019s what it is, is a movement. Now recent polls have shown that I\u2019m beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she\u2019s made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially. To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you. I want to thank you very, very much. To those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support. To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms. And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against and he\u2019s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that\u2019s what I do. We are going to have fantastic trade deals. We\u2019re going to start making money and bringing in jobs. Now I know some people say I\u2019m too much of a fighter. My preference is always peace, however and I\u2019ve shown that. I\u2019ve shown that for a long time. I built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always. My goal is always again to bring people together. But if I\u2019m forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down. Thank you. I\u2019ve fought for my family. I\u2019ve fought for my business. I\u2019ve fought for my employees. And now, I\u2019m going to fight for you, the American people like nobody has ever fought before. And I\u2019m not a politician fighting, I\u2019m me. You\u2019re going to see some real good things happen. Just remember this: I\u2019m going to be your champion. I\u2019m going to be America\u2019s champion because you see this election isn\u2019t about Republican or Democrat; it\u2019s about who runs this country \u2013 the special interests or the people and I mean the American people. Every election year politicians promise change. Obama promised change and it didn\u2019t work out too well. And every year they fail to deliver.

And you know, a lot of the press hasn\u2019t been very fair. Boy, look at the press back there. They must think there\u2019s a big event going happen today. Wow, that\u2019s a lot of them \u2013 it\u2019s like the Academy Awards. But we\u2019ve had an amazing \u2013 it\u2019s been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator. We came down that escalator and it was \u2013 I said, \"Let\u2019s go\" to my wife, who\u2019s been so supportive and so wonderful. I said, \"Let\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to make America great again. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\" And you know, it\u2019s hard to do this because when you think of it I\u2019ve never done it before. I\u2019ve never been a politician. Thank goodness but I\u2019ve never been a politician. I\u2019ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work. Tens of thousands of people over the years. And you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me. The Nevada poll just came out where I\u2019m leading with Hispanics, which I knew, I knew. And we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said I\u2019m going to run for president I gave up a lot. You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice. That\u2019s hard to do. You have a top show and you say, \"I\u2019m not doing it anymore. I\u2019m sorry.\" They wanted to do it so badly. And Steve Burke, who\u2019s a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said \"Come on, Donald. Come on. Do it. You\u2019re not going to run. Do it. Do it.\" I said, \"Steve, I\u2019m going to run.\" I was pretty sure. You know, that was about two months before. I was pretty sure. It really is a tough thing to do. You know, all my life I\u2019ve heard \"If you\u2019re a very successful person, you\u2019ll never run for president. You\u2019ll never really run for politics. But you\u2019ll never ever run for president.\" And I built a great company and it\u2019s a tremendous number. You saw the filings. The press was going to look so closely. It was like D-Day when we put those papers in. You know, first thing I did I announced. They said, \"Oh, he\u2019s actually going to do it\" because most of them said \"He\u2019ll never do it.\" Then when I signed...that\u2019s when you sign your life away. And I signed that. They said, \"Whoa! He signed that. Well, he\u2019ll never file his financials because maybe he\u2019s not as rich as everybody thinks.\"   And I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable \u2013 you didn\u2019t hear a thing about it. Oh boy, were they looking. I mean, were they looking. And almost 100 pages. The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that. And it showed a company that\u2019s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow. You know, the way it\u2019s supposed to be. And it\u2019s great. And the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States. We need that kind of thinking. We need that \u2013 whatever it is. We need a mentality that\u2019s going to \u2013 you know, we\u2019re at $19 trillion in debt. It\u2019s going to be up to $21 trillion. You saw that horrible budget. Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that\u2019s going to lift it. And so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and I\u2019ll tell you right now. You know, now that we\u2019re at it. And they came out some brand new ones \u2013 some beauties. And one\u2019s coming out \u2013 I guess a big one\u2019s coming out.

Somebody said it\u2019s a barn. This is a very nice barn actually. But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is. And we do have something special in a couple of minutes. To me, it\u2019s really special because it\u2019s a person that I think is a spectacular person. So it\u2019s very special to me.

You know, we talk about how well we\u2019re doing. So we have 50 million \u2013 almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it\u2019s got to end. One of the problems \u2013 we don\u2019t have enough jobs in this country. It\u2019s very simple. You know, it\u2019s so simple when you think about it. Our jobs have been taken away. And I\u2019ll tell you what else, middle income folks \u2013 their salaries haven\u2019t gone up in 12 years. People are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago. And other things have gone up. So they\u2019re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago. But that\u2019s an amazing stat. But people \u2013 one of the reasons they say I\u2019m doing so well because I let people know we\u2019re going to bring jobs back. We\u2019re going to bring industry and plants. We\u2019re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that. We\u2019re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they\u2019re working. Then the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs. I have some people that I know very well and they\u2019ve had a job for 20 years at the same place. All of a sudden they\u2019re working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better. They love the owners, the stores and things. They love the owners; they think the owners are great. But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs. They work all their life. They have a wonderful company that they\u2019re working for, and now all of a sudden they\u2019re cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare.

We\u2019re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up. Believe me. The numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that\u2019s a shame   \u2026Tell you what, as President, I can guarantee it. As Trump, I can say I\u2019ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won\u2019t stop.

The fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together. We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody\u2019s writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they\u2019re talking about it. Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many, many more people.

Wouldn\u2019t this be money better spent rebuilding America for our current population including the many poor people already living here. We have cities, we have inner cities...   We have poverty all over and this is how we\u2019re spending billions of dollars. We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States.

A mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clinton\u2019s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests. That\u2019s all it is. We\u2019ve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we\u2019ve got to do it now because later is too late \u2014 going to be too late for our country.

Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past.

For instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.

Every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases. Just a single event.

He\u2019s failed us and he\u2019s failed us badly. Under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse. And I\u2019ve been saying that for a long time. Each year the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security. In fact, Clinton\u2019s State Department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. Tell me, tell me \u2013 how stupid is that": {"in_response_to": [{"text": "The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn\u2019t want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States. In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally. I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans\u2014many of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.   The Mexican Government wants an open border as long as it\u2019s a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.   I have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples\u2019 great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours. To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade. I have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something Mexico doesn\u2019t want me to say. In actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that Univision, previously my friend, went ballistic. I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security.   I have lost a lot during this Presidential run defending the people of the United States. I have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for President. Macy\u2019s, NBC, Serta and NASCAR have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. Univision, because 70% of their business comes from Mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the Mexican Government. The last thing Mexico wants is Donald Trump as President in that I will make great trade deals for the United States and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.   Interestingly, Univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful IPO or high stock price\u2014not to mention that I am currently suing them for breach of contract. Remember, Univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest backers. After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave \"reviews\"\u2014there was very little criticism. It wasn\u2019t until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words. If there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.   The issues I have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to Make America Great Again! Additionally, I would be the best jobs President that God ever created. Let\u2019s get to work!       TRUMP: (OFF-MIKE) This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what\u2019s going on, and especially how poor she\u2019d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism. TRUMP: Even her former Secret Service agent, who\u2019s seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech very, very soon. But today, there\u2019s only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders. The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country\u2019s history. So many people \u2014 it\u2019s just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace. The horror is beyond description. The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever. Likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated. We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families. We mourn as one people for our nation\u2019s loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it. I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack. Thank you. Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando\u2019s LGBT community. They have been through something that nobody could ever experience. This is a very dark moment in America\u2019s history. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation. It\u2019s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation. It\u2019s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity. It\u2019s an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country. We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination. But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly. We\u2019re not acting clearly, we\u2019re not talking clearly, we\u2019ve got problems. If we don\u2019t get tough, and if we don\u2019t get smart, and fast, we\u2019re not going to have our country anymore. There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left. The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don\u2019t share its radical views, and they murdered plenty. The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan. The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here. That is a fact, and it\u2019s a fact we need to talk about. We have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly. We have an incompetent administration. And if I\u2019m elected president, that will not change, I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years. We have an administration that will not change. But if I get in there, it\u2019s going to change, and it\u2019s going to change quickly. We\u2019re going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.   TRUMP: Thank you. With 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore. We have to address these issues head-on. I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and I have to say many years but many are saying that I was right to do so. And although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on. We have to do it. It will be lifted \u2014 this ban \u2014 when and as a nation we\u2019re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. They\u2019re pouring in and we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons. Now, any class \u2014 it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States. And it\u2019s as he or she deems appropriate. Hopefully it\u2019s he in this case.   Thank you. I will use this power to protect the American people. When I\u2019m elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there\u2019s a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats. After a full ...   Thank you. And by the way we have no choice. After a full and partial and long \u2014 really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.   We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer. Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.  Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American.   I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.   This is not just a national security issue. It\u2019s a quality of life issue. If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \u2014 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now.   We need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores. And it\u2019s coming ...   With these people, folks, it\u2019s coming. We\u2019re importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president. Even our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we\u2019re letting into America. All of the September 11th hijackists were issued visas. Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS. The Boston bombers came here through political asylum. The male shooter in San Bernardino again whose name I will not mention was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.   TRUMP: Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold \u2014 five fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law. We admit many more, and that\u2019s just the way it is. We admit many more from other countries in the region. And I\u2019ll tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values. We want to remain a free and open society. Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders. We have to control, and we have to control them now, not later. Right now.   Thank you. Yet Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday. And, guess what, she will probably say them. She sort of has said them, but let\u2019s see what happens. She really has no choice, but she doesn\u2019t want to. However, she\u2019s really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words. She supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what\u2019s going wrong with our country and our borders. She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is and she won\u2019t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know. She\u2019s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world \u2014 true weakness. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but just a few weeks before San Bernardino, the slaughter, that\u2019s all it was was a slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words \"radical Islam.\" Here is what she said, exact quote, \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\" That is Hillary Clinton. So, she says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. No good. Not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. Thank you. She wants to take away American\u2019s guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us. Let them come into the country, we don\u2019t have guns. Let them come in, let them have all the fun they want. I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. I will be always defending the Second Amendment.   Thank you. Thank you. The bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into American and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing. In fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life. When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. It\u2019s deadly \u2014 totally deadly. The Obama administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information. We need this information so badly, and he stopped it. We don\u2019t have the support. We don\u2019t have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their job. They are not being allowed to do their job. And, they can do it well \u2014 better than anybody. We need a new leader. We need a new leader fast.   TRUMP: Thank you. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else. I refuse to be politically correct.   I want to do the right thing. I want to straighten things out and I want to make America great again.   The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if I\u2019m elected. As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks. They don\u2019t have those tools now.   We need an intelligence gathering system second to none. Second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly. I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense who\u2019ll know how to fight a war on radical Islamic terrorism.   And they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now. It\u2019s not right.   We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat. The Senate subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th. Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama\u2019s Department of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States. These Departments refused to comply. Nobody even knows why. They refused to comply. President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since September 11th. So important.

OUR MILITARY IS SO DEPLETED, OUR MILITARY HAS FIGHTER JETS THAT ARE IN USE FLOWN BY GREAT, GREAT AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE SO OLD, AND THEY CAN'T GET PARTS FOR THE FIGHTER JETS.

HILLARY CLINTON IS INCOMPETENT, OKAY. THE GREATEST SINGLE THING IN MY OPINION THAT SHE'S EVER DONE IS TO GET OUT OF THE E-MAIL PROBLEM. I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLE. SHE DID A GREAT JOB ON THAT. I THINK IT IS HER GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT. I THINK WHEN THEY LOOK BACK ON HILLARY CLINTON, THEY WILL SAY THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF HILLARY CLINTON WAS GETTING OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WITH E-MAIL TZ. HOUDINI COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN OUT. SHE WAS SO GUILTY. I HAVE A LIST. LOOK. PAGE AFTER PAGE OF THE LIES -- PAGE AFTER PAGE OF THE LIES. ALL OVER. LOOK AT THIS. PAGE, PAGE. LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO READ IT TO YOU. THE PRESS WOULD SAY, YOU SHOULD SPEND YOUR ENTIRE SPEECH TALKING ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON AND THE E-MAILS. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW WHAT, IT WAS ALL LIES, FOLKS. I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND BORE EVERYBODY. IT WAS SO HORRIBLE. IT WAS SO DISGUSTING. IT WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS. YOU LOOK AT GENERAL PETRAEUS AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM FOR A TINY FRACTION OF WHAT CROOKED HILLARY DID. YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE, FOR A TINY FRACTION, LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. SO I JUST TELL YOU THIS, WE HAVE A CANDIDATE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHO, IF SHE EVER GETS ELECTED, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE DISGUSTING YEARS OF OBAMA, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF WEAKNESS, IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF CIVIL UNREST. IT WILL BE FOUR MORE YEARS OF NOT WINNING WITH OUR MILITARY AND NOT WINNING AGAINST ISIS. THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW TO BEAT ISIS. THEY DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

NOW HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. HE JUST KNEW IT WAS BAD. I KNOW HOW TO FIX IT. BECAUSE I AM IN FAVOR OF FREE TRADE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY I'M AN ISOLATIONIST, WHEN YOU LOSE $800 BILLION A YEAR ON TRADE DEFICITS, MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE WORSE THING. BUT WE'LL STRAIGHT IT OUT.

WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST NEGOTIATORS, MAYBE THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD AND WE DON'T USE THEM. WE USE POLITICAL HACKS. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THERE THAT GOT IN FOR POLITICS. YOU COULD LOOK AT THE BIGGEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, AND IT IS SMALL POTATOES. IT IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO SOME OF THE MASSIVE TRADE DEALS. AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD NEVER BE NEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS. JUST LIKE WE HAVE SECRETARY OF STATE KERRY NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN, AND WHAT THEY DID TO HIM AND YOU BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING AND WHAT HE GAVE AWAY, ISRAEL IS IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY, FRANKLY WE'RE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY, AND WE MADE A POWER OUT OF IRAN.
