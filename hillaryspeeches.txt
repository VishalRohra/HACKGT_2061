Thank you all very, very much. Thank you for that amazing welcome. Thank you all for the great convention that we've had.  And Chelsea, thank you. I'm so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become. Thanks for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world.  And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago is still going strong. It's lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us. And I've even gotten a few words in along the way. On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my "Explainer-in-Chief" is still on the job.  I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and the friends of a lifetime. To all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight.  And to those of you who joined our campaign this week.  And what a remarkable week it's been.  We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton. And the man of hope, Barack Obama.  America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership, and I'm better because of his friendship. We heard from our terrific vice President, the one-and-only Joe Biden, who spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people. First Lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the President we elect is going to be their President, too.  And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine -- you're soon going to understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to Governor, and now Senator.  He'll make the whole country proud as our Vice President.  And I want to thank Bernie Sanders. Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary. You've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.  And to all of your supporters here and around the country: I want you to know, I've heard you. Your cause is our cause. Our country needs your ideas, energy, and passion. That's the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America. We wrote it together -- now let's go out there and make it happen together.  My friends, we've come to Philadelphia -- the birthplace of our nation -- because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today.  We all know the story. But we usually focus on how it turned out -- and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the King. Some wanted to stick it to the king, and go their own way. The revolution hung in the balance. Then somehow they began listening to each other … compromising, finding common purpose. And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation. That's what made it possible to stand up to a King. That took courage. They had courage. Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.  America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying. And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together. Our country's motto is e pluribus unum: "out of many, (we are) one."  Will we stay true to that motto? Well, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention.  He wants to divide us -- from the rest of the world, and from each other.  He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way from "Morning in America" to  "Midnight in America." He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.  “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”  Now we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good paying job can get one.  And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy. We will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight terrorism. There's a lot of work to do. Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash. There's too much inequality. Too little social mobility. Too much paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad.  But just look at the strengths we bring to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values.  Freedom and equality, justice and opportunity. We should be so proud that these words are associated with us.  That when people hear them -- they hear… America. So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not. Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do. And most of all, don't believe anyone who says: “I alone can fix it.” Those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.  Really? 'I alone can fix it?'   Isn't he forgetting? Troops on the front lines. Police officers and fire fighters who run toward danger. Doctors and nurses who care for us. Teachers who change lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem. Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe. He's forgetting every last one of us. Americans don't say:  “I alone can fix it.”  We say: “We'll fix it together.” Remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Two hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.  Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them. And you know how the community responded?  Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days. That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.  20 years ago, I wrote a book called “It Takes a Village.” A lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that?  This is what I mean: None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.  America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger.  I believe that with all my heart. That's why “Stronger Together” is not just a lesson from our history. It's not just a slogan for our campaign.  It's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build. A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in. A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. Where families are strong, communities are safe, and yes -- love trumps hate. That's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward.   And so it is with humility, determination, and boundless confidence in America's promise, that I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   Now, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage. As you know, I'm not one of those people. I've been your First Lady, served 8 years as a Senator from the great State of New York,  I ran for President and lost. Then I represented all of you as Secretary of State. But my job titles only tell you what I've done. They don't tell you why.  The truth is, through all these years of public service, the “service” part has always come easier to me than the “public” part.   I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.  So let me tell you. The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are. They used whatever tools they had -- whatever God gave them -- and whatever life in America provided -- and built better lives and better futures for their kids. My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years, because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right.  My dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.  When the war was over he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens. He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had. And he did. My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid. She was saved by the kindness of others. Her first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share.  The lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up. She made sure I learned the words of our Methodist faith: “Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.” I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school. I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school -- it just didn't seem possible. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she went through as a child. It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action. So we gathered facts.  We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.  It's a big idea, isn't it?  Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.   But how do you make an idea like that real?  You do it step-by-step, year-by-year… sometimes even door-by-door.  And my heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza on this stage, representing millions of young people who -- because of those changes to our laws -- are able to get an education.  It's true... I sweat the details of policy -- whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs. Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid - if it's your family.  It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your President.  Over the last three days, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me. People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine.  People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night. I first met Ryan as a seven-year old.   He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed forty pounds. Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids every year.  Lauren was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero. I was still thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others ten years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.   In this campaign, I've met so many people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House. I will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. For the struggling, the striving and the successful.  For those who vote for me and those who don't. For all Americans.  Tonight, we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union:  the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for President. Standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come. Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. Happy for boys and men, too -- because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit. So let's keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves. Because even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead. Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead. Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.   Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. That's real progress.  But none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.    We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.   I've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from so many of you who feel like the economy just isn't working. Some of you are frustrated -- even furious. And you know what? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should. Americans are willing to work -- and work hard.   But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period. Democrats are the party of working people, but we haven't done a good enough job showing that we get what you're going through, and that we're going to do something about it.   So I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.  My primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States, from my first day in office to my last. Especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind. From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.    And here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.  I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should. That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. And we'll pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United! I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other. And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again. I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs. I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to kick them out. Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together - and it's the right thing to do. Whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.   If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us.    If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty… join us. If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care… join us. If you believe that we should say “no” to unfair trade deals... that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers…join us.   If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions… join us. And yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay… join us.   Let's make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.  Now, you didn't hear any of this from Donald Trump at his convention. He spoke for 70-odd minutes -- and I do mean odd. And he offered zero solutions.  But we already know he doesn't believe these things. No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed, I love talking about mine.  In my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.  Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future. And we will transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs. Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all.   We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.  It's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, but students and families can't refinance theirs. And here's something we don't say often enough: College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job. We're going to help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it. We're going to give small businesses a boost. Make it easier to get credit.  Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks. In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.  We're going to help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the “woman card,” then Deal Me In! (Oh, you've heard that one?) Now, here's the thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them. And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes. Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90% of the gains have gone to the top 1%, that's where the money is. And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back.  And we'll put that money to work where it belongs … creating jobs here at home! Now I know some of you are sitting at home thinking, well that all sounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done?  How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Look at my record.  I’ve worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people.  And if you give me the chance, that’s what I’ll do as President. But Trump, he's a businessman.  He must know something about the economy.   Well, let's take a closer look.  In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you'll find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.   People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it -- not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them.  That sales pitch he's making to be your President?  Put your faith in him -- and you'll win big?  That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag.   He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado.  Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio.  Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin. Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again -- well, he could start by actually making things in America again.  The choice we face is just as stark when it comes to our national security. Anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face. From Baghdad and Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, to San Bernardino and Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated. No wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership. You want a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do it will be my highest priority. I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot -- now we have to enforce it, and keep supporting Israel's security.  I'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement -- now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.  I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia. I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen. We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country. It won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake -- we will prevail.    Now Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, “I know more about ISIS than the generals do….”  No, Donald, you don't. He thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are “a disaster.”  Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans  for many years, including as a Senator on the Armed Services Committee. I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure. We entrust our commander-in-chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces. Decisions about war and peace. Life and death.  A President should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country -- including the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.  Ask yourself:  Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a Presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started -- not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men -- the ones moved by fear and pride. America's strength doesn't come from lashing out. Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power.    That's the kind of Commander-in-Chief I pledge to be.   And if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a President who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.  I'm not here to repeal the 2nd Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place. We should be working with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.  For decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics were too hot to touch. But I ask you: how can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence. You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals. I refuse to believe we can't find common ground here.  We have to heal the divides in our country. Not just on guns, but on race, immigration, and more.  That starts with listening to each other.  Hearing each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes. So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable. Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job.  We will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We will defend all our rights -- civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights, and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities. And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from.  For the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments -- excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.  They think he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says -- like when he called women “pigs.” Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability. Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain --a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.  At first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either.  It was just too hard to fathom -- that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that.  But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump...This is it.And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great -- because America is good.  So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change.  He's offering empty promises.  What are we offering?  A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country - to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.  The choice is clear.  Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger. None of us can do it alone.  I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together again. But I'm here to tell you tonight -- progress is possible.  I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.  And I know it from my own life.  More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game. Like so much else, I got this from my mother.  She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. “Go back out there,” she said. And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies.  You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce. We lost my mother a few years ago. I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what. That's what we need to do together as a nation. Though "we may not live to see the glory," as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, "let us gladly join the fight."   Let our legacy be about "planting seeds in a garden you never get to see." That's why we're here...not just in this hall, but on this Earth. The Founders showed us that. And so have many others since.They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow. That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight. Yes, the world is watching what we do. Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose. So let's be stronger together. Looking to the future with courage and confidence. Building a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country. When we do, America will be greater than ever.  Thank you and may God bless the United States of America! Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, President Van Zant, and thanks to everyone at the New School for welcoming us today. I’m delighted to be back.  You know, over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to listen to Americans’ concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for them. It’s not delivering the way that it should. It still seems, to most Americans that I have spoken with, that it is stacked for those at the top.  But I’ve also heard about the hopes that people have for their future — going to college without drowning in debt; starting that small business they’ve always dreamed about; getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement.  Previous generations of Americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead. And when you get ahead, America gets ahead. But over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded. Our job is to make it strong again.  For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else. Yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working Americans.  Twice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind.     I think the results speak for themselves. Under President Clinton — I like the sound of that — America saw the longest peacetime expansion in our history.     Nearly 23 million jobs, a balanced budget and a surplus for the future, and most importantly, incomes rose across the board, not just for those already at the top. Eight years later, President Obama and the American people’s hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression. President Obama saved the auto industry, imposed new rules on Wall Street and provided health care to 16 million Americans.     Now today — today, as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer- term challenges come into focus, I believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy. You can’t have one without the other. We can’t create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth, and we can’t build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness. We need both.  Because while America standing again, we are not yet running the way we should. Corporate profits are at near record highs and Americans are working as hard as ever. But paychecks had nearly budged in real terms. Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets. Out of pocket costs of health care, child care, hearing for aging parents, are rising a lot faster than wages.  I hear this everywhere I go. A single mom talked about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids. She doesn’t expect anything to come easy. But if she got a raise, everything would not be quite so hard.  The grandmother who works around the clock providing child care to other people’s kids. She’s proud of her work, but the pay is fairly enough to live on, especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs.  The young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt. If he can grow his business, he can pay off his debt and pay his employees, including himself, more, too.  Millions of hardworking Americans tell similar stories. Wages need to rise to keep up with cost, paychecks need to grow. Families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead. The defining economic challenge of our time clear. We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans, so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive steady income growth that lifts up families, and lifts up our country. And that…     And that will be my mission, from the first day I am president to the last. I…     I will get up every day thinking about the families of America, like the family I came from, with a hard-working dad who started a small business and scrimped, and saved, and gave us a good middle- class life. I will be thinking about all the people that I represented in New York and the stories that they told me, and that I worked with them to improve. I will, as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that did not start with the Recession and will not end with the recovery.  You know, advances in technology and expanding global trade have created new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports. Too often they are polarizing our economy, benefiting high skilled workers, but displacing and downgrading blue-collar jobs and other mid-level jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of Americans.  Today’s marketplace focuses too much on the short-term, like second to second financial trading, and quarterly earnings reports, and too little on long-term investments. Meanwhile, many Americans are making extra money renting out a small room, designing websites, selling products they design themselves at home, or even driving their own car. This on-demand, or so-called gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation.  But it is also raising hard questions about work-place protections and what a good job will look like in the future.  So, all of these trends are real and none, none is going away. But they do not determine our destiny. The choices we make as a nation matter. And the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what American life in the middle class and our economy will be like in this century.  As president, I will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us, to strengthen, not hollow out, the American middle class. Because I think at our best, that’s what Americans do. We are problem solvers, not deniers. We don’t hide from change; we harness it.  The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hardworking families, not just for successful CEOs and money managers and not some just arbitrary growth targets untethered to people’s lives and livelihoods.     I want to see our economy work for the struggling, the striving and the successful. We’re not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past, we can’t go back to the old policies that failed us before, nor can we just replay the successes.  Today is not 1993. It’s not 2009. So we need solutions for the big challenges we face now.  So today, I’m proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hardworking Americans, an agenda for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth.  Let me begin with strong growth. More growth means more jobs and more new businesses. More jobs give people choices about where to work.  And employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones. That’s why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes.  Small businesses create more than 60 percent of new American jobs on net, so they have to be a top priority. I’ve said I want to be the small-business president, and I mean it. And throughout this campaign, I’m going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape, easier access to capital, tax relief and simplification.  I’ll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in America, closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas.     And I know it’s not always how we think about this, but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform.     I want you to hear this. Bringing millions of hardworking people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years.     Then there are the new public investments that will help establish businesses and entrepreneurs, create the next generation of high-paying jobs.  You know, when we get Americans moving, we get our country moving. So let’s establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds…     … channel those funds to finance world-class airports, railways, roads, bridges and ports.     And let’s built those faster broadband networks and make sure there’s a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice.     And really, there’s no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now.     Our economy obviously runs on energy, and the time has come to make America the clean-energy superpower. I advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs, save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change.  And let’s fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries, just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the 1990s and President Obama’s initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years.  I will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead.  But today, let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued: breaking down barriers so more Americans participate more fully in the workforce, especially women.     We are in a global competition, as I’m sure you have noticed. And we cant afford to leave talent on the sidelines. But that’s exactly what we’re doing today. When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future.  The movement of women into the American workforce over the past 40 years was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But that progress has stalled.  The United States used to rank 7th out of 24 advanced countries in women’s labor force participation. By 2013, we had dropped to 19th. That represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for American families.  Studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they’re expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not.  We should be making it easier for Americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers. Women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they’re going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick.  You know, last year –     – last year while I was at the hospital here in Manhattan, waiting for little Charlotte to make her grand entrance, one of the nurses said, thank you for fighting for paid leave. And we began to talk about it. She sees firsthand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of.  It’s time to recognize that quality, affordable childcare is not a luxury. It’s a growth strategy. And it’s way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job and women of color making even less.     You know, all this lost money adds up. And for some women, it’s thousands of dollars every year. Now I am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women’s issues. Well, those days are over.     Fair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days, childcare are essential to our competitiveness and our growth. And we can do this in a way that doesn’t impose unfair burdens on businesses, especially small businesses. As president, I’ll fight to put families first, just like I have my entire career.     Now beyond strong growth, we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of raising incomes. The evidence is in. Inequality is a drag on our entire economy. So this is the problem we need to tackle. Now, you may have heard Governor Bush say Americans just need to work longer hours. Well, he must not have met very many American workers.     Let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day, or the teacher who in that classroom or the trucker who drives all night. Let him tell that to the fast worker marching in the streets for better pay. They do not need a lecture. They need a raise.     The truth is the current rules for our economy do reward some work, like financial trading, for example much more than other work, like actually building and selling things, the work that has always been the backbone of our economy. To get all incomes rising again, we need to strike a better balance. If you work hard, you ought to be a fairly. So, we do have to raise the minimum wage, and implement President Obama’s new rules on overtime, and then we have to go further.     I will crack down on bosses who exploit employees by mis- classifying them as contractors or even steal their wages. To make paychecks stretch, we need to take on the major strains on family budgets. I will protect the Affordable Care Act and build on it to lower out-of-pocket health care costs.     And to make prescription drugs more affordable. We will help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing Social Security and making it easier to save for the future. Now, many of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle scarred. We need new ideas, as well, and one I believe in and will fight for is profit-sharing. Hard-working Americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce.  So, I will produce ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees. That is good for workers and good businesses. Studies show that profit sharing that gives everyone a stake in the company’s success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees’ pockets. It’s a win-win. Later this week in New Hampshire, I will have more to say about how we do this.  Another priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Senator Rubio’s would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.  Well, that is a sure budget busting giveaway to the super wealthy, and that’s the kind of bad economics you are likely to hear from any of the candidates on the other side. I have a different take…     … guided license principles. First, hard-working families need and deserve tax relief and simplification. Second, those at the top have to pay their fair share. That’s why I support the Buffet Rule, which makes sure millionaires do not pay lower rates than their secretaries. I have called for closing the carried interest loophole, that lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate.  And let’s agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything that America has to offer, should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share, especially while companies who can’t afford high-priced lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more.    CLINTON: Alongside tax reform, it’s time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power, which has been proven again and again to drive up wages. Republican governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers’ rights, and practically all the Republican candidates hope to do the same as president. I will fight back against these mean-spirited, misguided attacks. Evidence –     – evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men, so if we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers.     And let me just say a word here about trade. The Greek crisis as well as the Chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy. Trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades, but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hard-working communities.  So we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements. We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don’t. To create fair growth, we need to create opportunity for more Americans.  I love the saying by Abraham Lincoln who, in many ways, was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of government playing its role in providing opportunities. He talked about giving Americans a fair chance in the race of life. I believe that with all my heart, but I also believe it has to start really early, at birth.  High quality early learning, especially in the first five years, can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent. And –     – and I’m committed to seeing every 4-year-old in America have access to high quality pre-school in the next 10 years. But I want to do more. I want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community, our business community, our academic institutions, from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens, to really help parents, particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles, to really help prepare their own children in that 0 to 4 age group.  Eighty percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of 3. That’s why families like mine read, talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter. I’ve said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing.     But we do it not only because we love doing it, even though, I’ll admit, it’s embarrassing, you know, reading a book to a two-week-old or a six-week-old or a 10-week-old, but we do it because we understand it’s building her capacity for learning. And the research shows by the time she enters kindergarten, she will have heard 30 million more words than a child from a less advantaged background.  Think of what we are losing because we’re not doing everything we can to reach out to those families, and we know, again, from so much research here in the United States and around the world that that early help, that mentoring, that intervention to help those often stressed-out young moms understand more about what they can do and to avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to really get their child off to the best possible start.  We also have to invest in our students and our teachers at every level, and in the coming weeks and months, I will lay out specific steps to improve our schools, make college truly affordable and help Americans refinance their student debt.  And let’s embrace –     – let’s embrace the idea of lifelong learning. In an age of technological change, we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs.  There are exciting efforts underway and I want to support and scale the ones that show results.  As we pursue all these policies, we cant forget our fellow Americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing world from the inner cities to coal country to Indian country.  Talent is universal; you find it everywhere. But opportunity is not. There are nearly 6 million young people aged 16 to 24 in America today who are not in school or at work. The numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering.  A quarter of young black men and nearly 15 percent of all Latino youth cannot find a job. We’ve got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class.  I firmly believe that the best anti-poverty program is a job but that’s hard to say if there aren’t enough jobs for people that were trying to help lift themselves out of poverty.  That’s why Ive called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas. When –     – when all Americans have the chance to study hard, work hard and share in our country’s prosperity, that’s fair growth. It’s what I’ve always believed in and it’s what I will fight for as president.  Now the third key driver of income, alongside strong growth and fair growth, must be long-term growth. Too many pressures in our economy push us toward short-termism. Many business leaders see this. They’ve talked to me about it.  One has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism. They say everything is focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price and the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth: research and development, physical capital and talent.  Net business investment, which includes things like factories, machines and research labs, have declined as a share of the economy.  In recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends. That doesn’t leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make new investments necessary to ensure a company’s future success.  These trends need to change. And I believe many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities, not just to today’s share price but also to workers, communities and ultimately to our country and, indeed, our planet.  Now I’m not talking about charity; I’m talking about clear-eyed capitalism. Many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity, better service and larger profits.  Now it’s easy to try to cut costs by holding down or even decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but I would argue that’s bad for business in the long run and it’s really bad for our country.  Workers are assets. Investing in them pays off; higher wages pay off. Training pays off. To help more companies do that, I proposed a $1,500 tax credit for every worker they train and hire. And I will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longer-term investments that create jobs, more than just quick trades.     I will also propose reforms to help CEOs and shareholders alike to focus on the next decade rather than just the next day.     Making sure stock buybacks aren’t being used only for an immediate boost in share prices; empowering outside investors who want to build companies, but discouraging cut and run shareholders who act more like old-school corporate raiders. And nowhere will the shift from short-term to long-term be more important than on Wall Street.  As a former senator from New York, I know firsthand the role that Wall Street can and should play in our economy, helping main street grow and prosper, and boosting new companies that make America more competitive globally.  But as we all know in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk, and regulators in Washington either could not or would not keep up. I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight.  Under President Obama’s leadership we have imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on Wall Street. Those rules have been under assault by Republicans in Congress and those running for president. I will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we have made. We can do that, and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust.  We also have to go beyond Dodd-Frank. Too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky. And the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines. Serious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking system, including hedge funds, high-frequency traders, non- bank finance companies. So many new kinds of entities, which receive little oversight at all.  Stories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking. HSBC allowing drug cartels to launder money, five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates. There can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior.     And while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they have already pocketed the gains. This is wrong, and on my watch it will change. Over the course…     … over the course of this campaign, I will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections. I will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem. We will ensure…     We will ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee. And we will also process individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing.     When the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public, it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public. It could, for example, help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers.  Now, reform is never easy, but we’ve done it before in our country, and we have to get it right this time. And yes, we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us.  Two years ago, the head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Terry Duffy, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that really caught my attention.  He wrote, and I quote, “I’m concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who they serve and that the public knows it. Some Wall Streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of moneymaking game divorced from concerns of the Main Street,” unquote.  I think we should listen to Terry Duffy. Of course, long-term growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well.  So it’s time to end the era of budget brinkmanship and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another. It’s time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus how we’re going to tackle the big stuff together.  How do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys? Can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing? What are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors, like Silicon Valley?  Questions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policymakers and government, from our leaders in the private sector, our economists, our academics, others who can come together to the table and on behalf of America perform their patriotic duty to make sure our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing.     So government has to be smarter, simpler, more focused itself on long-term investments than short-term politics and be a better partner to cities, states and the private sector. Washington has to be a better steward of America’s tax dollars and Americans’ trust. And please, let’s get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology.     That’s what I’ll do as president. I will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality.        I want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together, and I will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable, including by continuing to restrain health care costs, which remain one of the key drivers of long-term deficits.  I will make sure Washington learns from how well local governments, businesses and nonprofits are working together in successful cities and towns across America.  You know, passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress. As president, I will use the power to convene, connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done, because above all, we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country.     I confess, maybe it’s the grandmother in me, but I believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you’ll never sit, and the vision I’ve laid out here today for strong growth, fair growth and long-term growth all working together will get incomes rising again, will help working families get ahead and stay ahead. That is the test of our time.  And I’m inviting everyone to please join me to do your part. That’s what great countries do. That’s what our country always has done. We rise to challenges. It’s not about left, right or center; it’s about the future versus the past.  I’m running for president to build an America for tomorrow, not yesterday, an America built on growth and fairness, an America where if you do your part, you will reap the rewards, where we don’t leave anyone behind.     Thank you all. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one more thought. I want every child, not just the granddaughter of a former president or former secretary of state, but every child to be able to reach for her God-given potential. Please join me in that mission — let’s do it together.  Thank you all so much. Fifty years after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. marched and John Lewis bled, it's hard to believe Americans are still forced to fight for their right to vote--especially in places where the civil rights movement fought so hard all those years ago. We'll fix it together. Stronger Together. Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can. I believe in making sure that people who sacrifice for us are given all the care and the benefits and support that they need. And I believe strongly that taking care of our veterans is part of our solemn duty as Americans. The era of big government is over. Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study. They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country's rate. What can we do across the nation to address this? My father gets just $16 in food assistance per month as part of Medicaid's family community program in Milwaukee County for low-income seniors. How will you as president work to ensure low-income seniors get their basic needs met? Are there any areas of government you would like to reduce?The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history. Can you name two leaders -- one American and one foreign -- who would influence your foreign policy decisions? And why do you see them as -- why are they influential? I won't cut Social Security. ... I'll defend it, and I'll expand it. Now, I will also defend Social Security and Medicare from the efforts of the Republicans to privatize both of them. When I was in the Senate, George Bush came up with a privatization plan. Some of you might remember that. It would have been a disaster. And we defeated it. As your president, I will defend it. I will not let anybody think that they can privatize it. But we're going to have to make sure that we shore it up so that it is there not just for those who are currently recipients but for generations to come. As [Cecile] rightly said, when you're standing up for what's right, it makes it somewhat less burdensome to face, in her case and later in my case, what was a stream of hostility. I took a lot away from her testimony. This should not be viewed as politics as usual. [Republican presidential candidates] are serious. They are in many respects appealing to the most anti-woman aspects of their party and unfortunately getting a response. I want to be that president that will say, "Forget about it. Don't waste your time; you know you're not getting past me. Too often, these are called women's issues. Well, I am a proud lifelong fighter for women's issues, because I firmly believe what's good for women is good for America.  As far as I'm concerned, any issue that affects women's lives and futures is a women's issue. I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault: Don't let anyone silence your voice. You have the right to be heard. For many workers, staying home to take care of a sick child or an aging parent means losing a paycheck--or worse, even losing a job. That is an impossible choice we shouldn't ask anyone to make--and yet American workers are forced to make it every day.  The movement of women into the American workforce over the past 40 years was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth. But that progress has stalled. The United States used to rank seventh out of 24 advanced countries in women's labor force participation. By 2013, we had dropped to 19th. That represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for American families. Studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they're expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not. We should be making it easier for Americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers. Women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they're going to take care of their children, or what will happen if a family member gets sick.  Thank you all so much. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. It's sort of like the seventh inning stretch. Thank you all. You know, I've been saying at events like this lately, I am all that stands between you and the apocalypse. Tonight, I'm all that stands between a much better outcome! I want to thank Laverne for being here at her first political event. Her endorsement, her strong words, her passion, her example, her advocacy on behalf of the transgender community, particularly transgender women of color, is just so extraordinary, and I love the way she wove in so many of the issues that are up for grabs in this election.  I think we know what we're up against. We do, don't we?  Donald Trump has pledged for appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality--  And if you have read about the ones he says he's likely to support, he's not kidding. In fact, if you look at his running mate, his running-mate signed a law that would have allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBT Americans. And there's so much more than I find deplorable in his campaign: the way that he cozies up to white supremacist, makes racist attacks, calls women pigs, mocks people with disabilities -- you can't make this up. He wants to round up and deport 16 million people, calls our military a disaster. And every day he says something else which I find so personally offensive, but also dangerous. You know, the idea of our country is so rooted in continuing progress that we make together. Our campaign slogan is not just words. We really do believe that we are stronger together. We really do believe that showing respect and appreciation for one another lifts us all up.  And it's a special commitment that I feel to continuing to fight alongside the LGBT community. Because this is one of the continuing struggles. We're filled in this great hall in Cipriani tonight with successful people, raising your glow sticks, thank you so much for contributing a little bit more to get the campaign over the finish line. But somewhere right now in this city is a kid has been kicked out of his house. Somewhere not far from here, maybe a suburb or across state lines, is a young girl who is just not sure what her future holds because she just doesn't feel like she's herself and no one understands that. Some kid getting off the bus at the Port Authority and somebody's waiting to take advantage of that scared but brave kid looking for a different life and a future that actually belongs to him or her.  We still have a lot of work to do. And if you think of the work we have to do in our own country, it pales in comparison to the word we have to do around the world. And I'm grateful that in this room are so many people who have broken down barriers, stood up to discrimination and bigotry, fought for the rights of everyone. I was in North Carolina just yesterday and I told them, it's not only that discrimination is wrong. It's bad for business. That state which was led down a pathway of discrimination is seeing the results -- losing jobs, losing the NBA all star game. Who wants to be associated with a governor and a legislation who set out to hurt the people they're supported to be representing and protecting?  In too many places still, LGBT Americans are singled out for harassment and violence. You can get married on Saturday, post your pictures on Sunday, and get fired on Monday. That's why we've got to continue the forward march of progress.  And we cannot do it alone. I cannot do it alone. I'm not like Donald Trump who says "I alone can fix it.' I've never quire figure out what it is he alone can fix.  But that's not what you'll hear from me. I think we have to do this together. So, together we're gonna pass the Equality Act to guarantee full equality. We're going to put comprehensive quality affordable health care within reach for more people, including for mental health and addiction. We're gonna take on youth homelessness, and as my wonderful, extraordinary, great daughter said, we are going to end the cruel and dangerous practice of conversion therapy. We're going to keep working toward an AIDS-free generation, a goal that I set as secretary of state, and with your help we're going to pass comprehensive gun laws  I know there are only 60 days left to make our case -- and don't get complacent, don't see the latest outrageous, offensive, inappropriate comment and think well he's done this time. We are living in a volatile political environment. You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic -- you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people -- now how 11 million. He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks -- they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America. But the other basket -- and I know this because I see friends from all over America here -- I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas -- as well as, you know, New York and California -- but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they're just desperate for change. It doesn't really even matter where it comes from. They don't buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different. They won't wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroine, feel like they're in a dead-end. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.    And what I hope is that in addition to your extraordinary generosity, you will go to our website, hillaryclinton.com, or text join to JOIN at 47246 to see how else you can get involved.  And I want to echo what Chelsea said. We are trying to register 3 million more voters and get those voters to commit to vote. We will win if people turn out to vote. There is no doubt in my mind that we will win. But we can't take anyone or any place for granted. And therefore I am asking you to volunteer for a phone bank, for a canvas -- at the very least if you know anybody who's even thinking about voting for Trump, stage an intervention! That may be one conversion therapy I endorse. Just remember: Friends don't let friends vote for Trump.  So we're going to have a great night tonight because we are so blessed. You know, we all love this woman either from afar or luckily enough up close -- and for my family, it's been up close. We know she's the great talent of our time. We know that remarkably she's had a number one album in each of the last six decades. We know that. But we also feel and see her heart and her passion. And she's of course been a great ally and supporter of the LGBT community -- but of progressive causes and candidates, she's been on the front lines repeatedly, bravely, never giving up or giving in to all of the incoming criticism that any of us who stick our necks out often attract. So we're in for a great treat tonight. I could not be happier, more grateful, or excited, than to introduce a woman of such extraordinary presence, that really just her first name -- spelled correctly -- is more than enough. Please welcome, Barbra Streisand!  Last night, I was very glad to be able to begin a conversation with the American people, and offer some of my thoughts about ISIS, Iran, and how we reform the V.A. system to provide better care for our vets. And I'm honored that in the last 24 hours, more retired generals and admirals have decided to endorse my campaign.  To focus more on these crucial challenges, tomorrow I'm convening a meeting of bipartisan national security leaders and experts, including former secretaries of homeland security, Michael Chertoff and Janet Napolitano; General John Allen; former acting director of the CIA Michael Morell; and former NATO supreme allied commander James Stavridis, and others.  We will discuss how to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS and keep our country safe. To that end, I want to underscore something that I mentioned last night. We should make it a top priority to hunt down the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and bring him to justice just as we did with Osama bin Laden. As with that operation, getting al-Baghdadi will require a focused effort driven at the highest levels. But I believe it will send a resounding message that nobody directs or inspires attacks against the United States and gets away with it.  Let me be clear: Last night was yet another test, and Donald Trump failed yet again. We saw more evidence that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be commander in chief.  He trash-talks American generals, saying they've been, quote, "reduced to rubble." He suggested he would fire them and replace them with his hand-picked generals. He attacked dozens of former flag officers by saying that, quote, "We've (sic) been losing for us for a long time."  That's how he talks about distinguished men and women who have spent their lives serving our country, sacrificing for us. That's how he would act as commander in chief.  Meanwhile, bizarrely once again, he praised Russia's strongman Vladimir Putin, even taking the astonishing step of suggesting that he prefers the Russian president to our American president. Now, that is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country, as well as to our commander in chief. It is scary because it suggests he will let Putin do whatever Putin wants to do, and then make excuses for him.  CLINTON: I was just thinking about all of the presidents that would just be looking at one another in total astonishment. What would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks America's generals and heaps praise on Russia's president? I think we know the answer.  And when asked how he would stop the spread of global terrorism, Trump's answer was simply "take the oil." The United States of America does not invade other countries to plunder and pillage. We don't send our brave men and women around the world to steal oil. And that's not even getting into the absurdity of what it would involve: massive infrastructure, large numbers of troops, many years on the ground. Of course, Trump hasn't thought through any of that.  Every Republican holding or seeking office in this country should be asked if they agree with Donald Trump about these statements.  Now, one thing you didn't hear from Trump last night is any plan to take on ISIS, one of the biggest threats facing our country. He says his plan is still a secret, but the truth is he simply doesn't have one. And that's not only dangerous. It should be disqualifying.  So I have a very different vision for how we keep our country safe and strong. I respect the men and women who put their lives on the line to serve America. I will work with our allies to defeat ISIS. And I will hold true to our country's most cherished values.  You know, even with all of the attention paid to the campaign, we cannot forget how important this decision is. This weekend is the 15th anniversary of 9/11. I will never forget the horror of that day, but I will never forget either the victims and survivors, and the brave first responders and emergency responders that I met with and served and worked for as senator from New York.  That's what kept me working so hard in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families. That's who I was thinking of 10 years later in the White House situation room with President Obama when the decision was made to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. That's the kind of commander in chief I will be, someone who will bring us together in common purpose to keep our people safe and our country strong.  QUESTION: Madam Secretary, the latest Real Clear Politics average has you up by an average of 2.8 percentage points over Donald Trump. Given what you say are his historic inadequacies and disqualification on the commander in chief point that you just made, shouldn't you just basically be running away with it at this point?  CLINTON: Well, as I've said many, many times, I've always thought this was going to be a close election. That's why we've been putting organizations in place, gearing up for these final weeks, to mobilize and turn out our voters. That's exactly what we're going to do.  And I feel we're in a strong position, but we're not taking anyplace, anyone, anything for granted. We're going to keep working as hard as we can and hopefully pull out as many voters who agree with me as we possibly can muster. I think putting a big contingent of American ground troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria would not be in the best interest of the fight against ISIS and other terrorist groups. In fact, I think it would fulfill one of their dearest wishes, which is to drag the United States back into a ground war in that region.  However, I've been very clear, and I said this again last night, I support the air campaign. I support special forces. I support enablers. I support surveillance, intelligence and reconnaissance. I will absolutely be prepared to do whatever is necessary to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground to take out as much of the infrastructure of ISIS from the air; to go after Baghdadi, as I said today, with a very focused commitment to taking him off the battlefield.   I think the approach I've outlined intensifies what we are doing, but also recognizes that there is no, in my opinion, path forward to ground troops that would be in our interests.   I think there will be a lot of Ph.D. theses and popular journalism writing on that subject for years to come. I don't take my advice and I don't take anything seriously that comes from the RNC.  We were talking about serious issues last night. I know the difference between what we have to do to fix the V.A., what we have to do to take the fight to ISIS, than just making political happy talk.  And I had a very short window of time in that event last night to convey the seriousness with which I would approach the issues that concern our country.  Donald Trump chose to talk about his deep admiration and support for Vladimir Putin. Maybe he did it with a smile and I guess the RNC would've liked that.  I have been somewhat heartened by the number of articles recently pointing out the quite disparate treatment of Trump and his campaign compared to ours. I don't understand the reasons for it. I find it frustrating, but its just part of the landscape that we live in and we just keep forging ahead.  Look, I -- I think this is a really important moment for everybody in our country, as you have seen by the numbers of Republicans concerned about Trump coming forward and saying, "This is not acceptable."  They are willing to put their names out there, people who've never endorsed a Democrat, people who've never endorsed before because they are so concerned about this man and how totally unqualified he is to be president and how totally temperamentally unfit he is to be commander in chief.  So I know that he says outrageous things on a, you know, pretty regular basis. And I know that's part of the coverage and I know that it may be difficult to feel that you know exactly how to respond to some of his behavior.  But we're on the brink of making a very critical decision for our country. And if I were not the candidate, if I were not the nominee, if I were just a concerned citizen, I'd be out here doing everything I could to sound the alarm about someone like Donald Trump getting anywhere near the White House.  And I will continue to do that.  I mean the Republicans are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee. I have no sympathy for them. It's their nominee. But I am not going to tolerate them continuing to make misleading, inaccurate accusations and putting out misinformation about me.  And here's the latest example. Matt Olsen, the very distinguished and effective former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, was so disturbed by what he has seen coming from the Trump campaign that he wrote an article that I guess came online in the last 48 hours, pulling from public sources, very clear statements by ISIS leaders, essentially throwing whatever support they have to Donald Trump.  They have, as Matt Olsen pointed out, said they hoped that Allah delivers America to Trump. They have said that they hope that he is the president because it would give even more motivation to every jihadi, someone who has insulted Muslims; has insulted a Gold Star family of an incredibly heroic Captain Khan; someone who has said he doesn't want to let Muslims around the world even come to our country.  That is a gift for ISIS, and that is what Matt Olsen, who knows more about this than the Republicans trying to somehow muddy the waters, very clearly stated. That's what I mean.  And look, I'm not asking for any special treatment. I -- I know the road that I'm on. I've been on it for 25 years, and I just get up every day and keep moving forward. I love this country. I will serve it with my entire heart, mind and soul. I will do everything I can to protect America.  And I will do everything I can to make sure Donald Trump is not president, for many reasons, but this latest information coming from a distinguished counterterrorism expert should put every American's mind in motion to try to figure out what everyone can do to prevent Trump from being the president.  This is a great way to start my day. And I'm delighted to be here with you. I want to thank Marc for not only the introduction, but all of his work over the years. I have been a fan of Marc's since he was mayor of New Orleans. He did great work there&#8202;--&#8202;and he's doing great work at the National Urban League. So thank you, Marc. And we're all thinking, as I hope we do every year, about New Orleans as we near the 10th anniversary of Katrina. Something like that should never be allowed to happen in the United States of America again. So we have to keep learning the lessons and re-pledging our commitment.  I want to thank everyone for welcoming me here today. I want to give a shout-out to your national chairman of the board Michael Neidorff; also, backstage I saw a longtime friend of mine, Congressman Alcee Hastings; and Alexis Herman, who served in my husband's administration; and Tony West, who served in President Obama's administration. There's a veritable hall of fame here for this event. And I can never come to a National Urban League gathering without mentioning my lifelong friend Vernon Jordan. He may not be here today, but he's with us in spirit because of his deep love and commitment to this organization.  It's also close to my heart. Over the years, I've gotten the chance to work with you, learn from you. I've pored over your State of Black America reports, I've spoken at your conferences, but most importantly, I've seen how you change people's lives.  The theme of this conference&#8202;--&#8202;"Saving Our Cities: Education, Jobs and Justice"&#8202;--&#8202;speaks to the important work that you've been doing for decades. I know that you help black entrepreneurs get start-up capital. I know you help people find jobs. I know you give families financial counseling so they can achieve their dreams of buying a home or sending their kids to college. And you make sure parents have the tools to take care of their kids' health. That's the kind of day-to-day commitment that makes such a difference. As you help prepare young people for college and work in a world that can sometimes make them feel that they're not very important, you make sure they know just how precious and powerful they really are.  This vital work has been my work too. My first job out of law school wasn't at some big law firm; it was with the Children's Defense Fund, started by Marian Wright Edelman. That first summer after I graduated, I went door to door for kids shut out of school and denied the education they deserve. I also began a lifelong concern by working with the CDF to try to figure out what we did with kids caught up in the juvenile and adult prison systems. As First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program. You were an ally in doing that. As Senator, I championed small businesses owned by women and people of color, because that's where a lot of the jobs in America come from. I fought to raise the minimum wage&#8202;--&#8202;because no one who works hard in America should have to raise their kids in poverty.  These issues&#8202;--&#8202;your issues&#8202;--&#8202;are deeply personal to me. So I'm here early on this morning, first and foremost, to say thank you. But I'm also here to talk about the future&#8202;--&#8202;because the work you have been doing is more important than ever, and I'm going to keep doing that work right alongside you.  Now, I would love nothing more than to stay and have a conversation for hours, going into depth about every single issue that we are worried about, but you have a full slate of speakers that will follow me. So let me make three points about the work we need to do together.  First: The opportunity gap that America is facing is not just about economic inequality. It is about racial inequality. Now, that may seem obvious to you, but it bears underscoring because some of the evidence that backs it up would come as a shock to many Americans. Like how African Americans are nearly three times as likely as whites to be denied a mortgage. Or how, in 2013, the median wealth for white families was more than $134,000&#8202;--&#8202;but for African American families, it was just $11,000.  A lot of people don't realize that our schools are more segregated today than they were in 1968. Or even that African Americans are sentenced to longer prison terms than white people for the same crimes. Or that political operatives are trying every trick in the book to prevent African Americans from voting.  And listen to this one, because as somebody who started with the Children's Defense Fund and who now is the proud and delighted grandmother of a 10-month-old granddaughter&#8202;--&#8202;African American children are 500 percent&#8202;--&#8202;500 percent&#8202;--&#8202;more likely to die from asthma than white kids. Now, I studied and advocated and introduced legislation to close health disparities. I knew how severe they were, but 500 percent?  So all of this points to an unavoidable conclusion: race. Race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind. And yes, while that's partly a legacy of discrimination that stretches back to the start of our nation, it is also because of discrimination that is still ongoing.  I'm not saying anything you don't already know. You understand this better than I do&#8202;--&#8202;better than anyone. But I want to say it anyway. Because I'm planning to be President, and anyone who seeks that office has a responsibility to say it. And more than that, to grapple with the systemic inequities that so many Americans face. Anyone who asks for your vote should try their hardest to see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be. So I want you to know I see it and I hear you. And the racial disparity you work hard every day to overcome go against everything I believe in, and everything I want to help America achieve.  The second point is this: This is not just about statistics, as damning as they can be. This is about Americans doing some soul-searching and holding ourselves to account. This is about all of us looking into our hearts, examining our assumptions and fears, and asking ourselves: What more can I do in my life to counter hate and injustice? How can I make our country a better, fairer place?  Let me be clear: I think all of us need to do that kind of introspection. But those of us who have not experienced systemic racial inequities&#8202;--&#8202;we have an extra obligation. We need to do a better job of listening when people talk about the seen and unseen barriers they face every day. We need to practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone's experiences. And yes, we need to try, as best we can, to walk in one another's shoes&#8202;--&#8202;to imagine what it would be like to sit our son down and have "the talk," or if people followed us around stores, or locked their car doors when we walked past.  That empathy&#8202;--&#8202;that's what makes it possible for people from every background, every race, every religion, to come together as one nation. That's the kind of generosity of spirit that makes a country like America endure. And given what we've seen and experienced over the last two years, this is an urgent call for people to search their own hearts and minds.  Here's my third point: We've arrived at a moment when all these challenges are in sharp relief, and we have to seize it. Too many times now, Americans have come together, in shock and horror, to process a violent, senseless tragedy. Like Trayvon Martin, shot to death not in some empty, desolate street somewhere, but in a gated community. He wasn't a stranger, he had family there. Or Sandra Bland, a college-educated young woman who knew her rights, who didn't do anything wrong, but still ended up dying in a jail cell. Together, we've mourned Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, Walter Scott and Freddie Gray, and most recently, Sam Dubose. These names are emblazoned on our hearts. We've seen their faces, we've heard their grieving families. We've seen a massacre in Charleston, and black churches set on fire&#8202;--&#8202;today, in 2015. But thankfully, tragedy is not all we have seen. Yes, the Confederate battle flag came down finally in South Carolina. The families of the Charleston victims reached out with extraordinary grace to the man who killed their loved ones. And President Obama delivered a eulogy that sounded as though it had come straight from angels, ending with Amazing Grace. Young people have taken to the streets, dignified and determined, urging us to affirm the basic fact that black lives matter. And because of people across this country sharing their stories with courage and strength, a growing number of Americans are realizing what many of you have been saying for a long time&#8202;--&#8202;we can't go on like this; we are better than this; things must change.  Now, it's up to us to build on that momentum, and we all have to do our part&#8202;--&#8202;but those of us who strive to lead have a special responsibility.  I'm very pleased that many presidential candidates will be here today to address you. It is a signal that the work you've been doing&#8202;--&#8202;laboring in the vineyards for decades&#8202;--&#8202;is getting the political attention it deserves. But the real test of a candidate's commitment is not whether we come to speak at your national conference, as important as that is. It's whether we're still around after the cameras are gone and the votes are counted. It's whether our positions live up to our rhetoric.  And too often we see a mismatch between what some candidates say in venues like this, and what they actually do when they're elected. I don't think you can credibly say that everyone has a "right to rise" and then say you're for phasing out Medicare or for repealing Obamacare. People can't rise if they can't afford health care. They can't rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on. They can't rise if their governor makes it harder for them to get a college education. And you cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right to vote.  So yes, what people say matters, but what they do matters more. Americans, especially today, deserve leaders who will face inequity, race and justice issues in all their complexity head on&#8202;--&#8202;who won't just concede that there are barriers holding people back, who will do instead what it takes to tear those barriers down, once and for all.  I will never stop working on issues of equality and opportunity, race and justice. That is a promise. I've done it my entire adult life. I will always be in your corner. Because issues like these&#8202;--&#8202;they are why I'm running for president. They are why I got involved in public service in the first place&#8202;--&#8202;to tear down the barriers that hold people back from developing their talents and achieving their dreams.  I'm asking you to hold me accountable, to hold all of us accountable. Because the work that you're doing must lead to action. And you deserve leaders who not only get that, but who will work hard every day to make our country a better place&#8202;--&#8202;to make it live up to its potential and to provide the opportunities for every single child in this country to live up to his or her God-given potential.  Yes, I do have this 10-month-old grandchild now, and I've got to tell you&#8202;--&#8202;those of you who already have reached this incredible, transformational point in your lives understand this&#8202;--&#8202;there is nothing like it to focus you on the present. When Bill and I are with Charlotte, doing our best to babysit&#8202;--&#8202;the phones are off, the TV is off; we're just focused on this miracle of life. And we're the kind of grandparents, I'll confess, that when she learns to clap her hands we give her a standing ovation. But you see, it's not just about our granddaughter, is it? We, of course, will do everything we can to make sure she has all the opportunities she should&#8202;--&#8202;as a citizen of this country, as a child of God, as a person who has the right to go as far as her hard work and talent will take her. But that's not enough. I don't want that just for my granddaughter. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker who worked from the time he was a teenager to the time he retired in the Scranton lace mills. I know how blessed I've been, and opportunities that I had that others with just as much talent did not.  So let us tear down the barriers so no matter whose child you are or grandchild you are, you too will have the same chance. I'm proud to be your ally. I'm committed to being your partner. I will keep fighting right alongside you, today and always, to make the United States of America a country where all men and women, all boys and girls, are treated as they deserve to be&#8202;--&#8202;as equals. I know we can do this. I know the path ahead is not easy. But I'm absolutely convinced that we will once again join hands and make a difference for those young people who not only need a path, but need the love and embrace of a grateful nation for the contributions they each will make to a better future for us all. Thank you, Reno! It's great to be back in Nevada  My original plan for this visit was to focus on our agenda to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.  This week we proposed new steps to cut red tape and taxes, and make it easier for small businesses to get the credit they need to grow and hire.  Because I believe that in America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. We'll be talking a lot more about our economic plans in the days and weeks ahead. But today, I want to address something I hear from Americans all over our country.  Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the divisive rhetoric coming from my opponent in this election. It's like nothing we've heard before from a nominee for President of the United States.  From the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia.  He's taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of America's two major political parties.  His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.  In just the past week, under the guise of "outreach" to African Americans, Trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and described black communities in insulting and ignorant terms:  "Poverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership.  Crime at levels nobody has seen  Those are his words.  Donald Trump misses so much.  He doesn't see the success of black leaders in every field  The vibrancy of black-owned businessesOr the strength of the black church He doesn't see the excellence of historically black colleges and universities or the pride of black parents watching their children thriveAnd he certainly doesn't have any solutions to take on the reality of systemic racism and create more equity and opportunity in communities of color.  It takes a lot of nerve to ask people he's ignored and mistreated for decades, "What do you have to lose?" The answer is everything!  Trump's lack of knowledge or experience or solutions would be bad enough.  But what he's doing here is more sinister.  Trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.  It's a disturbing preview of what kind of President he'd be.  This is what I want to make clear today:  A man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the internet, should never run our government or command our military.  If he doesn't respect respect all Americans, he can't serve all Americans!  Now, I know some people still want to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.  They hope that he will eventually reinvent himself -- that there's a kinder, gentler, more responsible Donald Trump waiting in the wings somewhere.  After all, it's hard to believe anyone -- let alone a nominee for President of the United States -- could really believe all the things he says.  But the hard truth is, there's no other Donald Trump. This is it.  Maya Angelou once said: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."  Well, throughout his career and this campaign, Donald Trump has shown us exactly who he is. We should believe him.  When Trump was getting his start in business, he was sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments to black and Latino tenants.  Three years later, the Justice Department took Trump back to court because he hadn't changed.  The pattern continued through the decades.  State regulators fined one of Trump's casinos for repeatedly removing black dealers from the floor. No wonder the turn-over rate for his minority employees was way above average.  And let's not forget Trump first gained political prominence leading the charge for the so-called "Birthers."  He promoted the racist lie that President Obama isn't really an American citizen -- part of a sustained effort to delegitimize America's first black President.  In 2015, Trump launched his own campaign for President with another racist lie. He described Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.  And he accused the Mexican government of actively sending them across the border. None of that is true.  Oh, and by the way, Mexico's not paying for his wall either.  If it ever gets built, you can be sure that American taxpayers will be stuck with the bill.  Since then, there's been a steady stream of bigotry.  We all remember when Trump said a distinguished federal judge born in Indiana couldn't be trusted to do his job because, quote, "He's a Mexican."  Think about that.  The man who today is the standard bearer of the Republican Party said a federal judge was incapable of doing his job solely because of his heritage.  Even the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, described that as "the textbook definition of a racist comment."  To this day, he's never apologized to Judge Curiel.  But for Trump, that's just par for the course.  This is someone who retweets white supremacists online, like the user who goes by the name "white-genocide-TM." Trump took this fringe bigot with a few dozen followers and spread his message to 11 million people.  His campaign famously posted an anti-Semitic image -- a Star of David imposed over a sea of dollar bills -- that first appeared on a white supremacist website.  The Trump campaign also selected a prominent white nationalist leader as a delegate in California. They only dropped him under pressure.  When asked in a nationally televised interview whether he would disavow the support of David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, Trump wouldn't do it. Only later, again under mounting pressure, did he backtrack.  And when Trump was asked about anti-Semitic slurs and death threats coming from his supporters, he refused to condemn them.  Through it all, he has continued pushing discredited conspiracy theories with racist undertones.  Trump said thousands of American Muslims in New Jersey cheered the 9/11 attacks. They didn't.  He suggested that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the Kennedy assassination. Perhaps in Trump's mind, because he was a Cuban immigrant, he must have had something to do with it. Of course there's absolutely no evidence of that.  Just recently, Trump claimed President Obama founded ISIS. And then he repeated that nonsense over and over.  His latest paranoid fever dream is about my health. All I can say is, Donald, dream on.  This is what happens when you treat the National Enquirer like Gospel.  It's what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs. He said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there.  Trump didn't challenge those lies. He went on Jones' show and said: "Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down."  This man wants to be President of the United States.  I've stood by President Obama's side as he made the toughest decisions a Commander-in-Chief ever has to make.  In times of crisis, our country depends on steady leadership clear thinking and calm judgment because one wrong move can mean the difference between life and death.  The last thing we need in the Situation Room is a loose cannon who can't tell the difference between fact and fiction, and who buys so easily into racially-tinged rumors.  Someone detached from reality should never be in charge of making decisions that are as real as they come.  It's another reason why Donald Trump is simply temperamentally unfit to be President of the United States.  Now, some people will say that his bluster and bigotry is just over-heated campaign rhetoric -- an outrageous person saying outrageous things for attention.  But look at the policies Trump has proposed. They would put prejudice into practice.  And don't be distracted by his latest attempts to muddy the waters.  He may have some new people putting new words in his mouth but we know where he stands.  He would form a deportation force to round up millions of immigrants and kick them out of the country.  He'd abolish the bedrock constitutional principle that says if you're born in the United States, you're an American citizen. He says that children born in America to undocumented parents are, quote, "anchor babies" and should be deported.  Millions of them.  And he'd ban Muslims around the world -- 1.5 billion men, women, and children --from entering our country just because of their religion.  Think about that for a minute. How would it actually work? People landing in U.S. airports would line up to get their passports stamped, just like they do now.  But in Trump's America, when they step up to the counter, the immigration officer would ask every single person, "What is your religion?"  And then what?  What if someone says, "I'm a Christian," but the agent doesn't believe them.  Do they have to prove it? How would they do that?  Ever since the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, America has distinguished itself as a haven for people fleeing religious persecution.  Under Donald Trump, America would distinguish itself as the only country in the world to impose a religious test at the border.  Come to think of it, there actually may be one place that does that. It's the so-called Islamic State. The territory ISIS controls. It would be a cruel irony if America followed its lead.  Don't worry, some will say, as President, Trump will be surrounded by smart advisors who will rein in his worst impulses.  So when a tweet gets under his skin and he wants to retaliate with a cruise missile, maybe cooler heads will be there to convince him not to.  Maybe.  But look at who he's put in charge of his campaign.  Trump likes to say he only hires the "best people." But he's had to fire so many campaign managers it's like an episode of the Apprentice.  The latest shake-up was designed to -- quote -- "Let Trump be Trump." To do that, he hired Stephen Bannon, the head of a right-wing website called Breitbart.com, as campaign CEO.  To give you a flavor of his work, here are a few headlines they've published:  "Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy."  "Would You Rather Your Child Had Feminism or Cancer?"  "Gabby Giffords: The Gun Control Movement's Human Shield"  "Hoist It High And Proud: The Confederate Flag Proclaims A Glorious Heritage."  That one came shortly after the Charleston massacre, when Democrats and Republicans alike were doing everything they could to heal racial divides. Breitbart tried to enflame them further.  Just imagine -- Donald Trump reading that and thinking: "this is what I need more of in my campaign."  Bannon has nasty things to say about pretty much everyone.  This spring, he railed against Paul Ryan for, quote "rubbing his social-justice Catholicism in my nose every second."  No wonder he's gone to work for Trump -- the only Presidential candidate ever to get into a public feud with the Pope.  According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, Breitbart embraces "ideas on the extremist fringe of the conservative right. Racist ideas.  Race-baiting ideas. Anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideas ---- all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the "Alt-Right.'"  Alt-Right is short for "Alternative Right."  The Wall Street Journal describes it as a loosely organized movement, mostly online, that "rejects mainstream conservatism, promotes nationalism and views immigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity."  The de facto merger between Breitbart and the Trump Campaign represents a landmark achievement for the "Alt-Right." A fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party.  This is part of a broader story -- the rising tide of hardline, right-wing nationalism around the world.  Just yesterday, one of Britain's most prominent right-wing leaders, Nigel Farage, who stoked anti-immigrant sentiments to win the referendum on leaving the European Union, campaigned with Donald Trump in Mississippi.  Farage has called for a ban on the children of legal immigrants from public schools and health services, has said women are quote "worth less" than men, and supports scrapping laws that prevent employers from discriminating based on race -- that's who Trump wants by his side  The godfather of this global brand of extreme nationalism is Russian President Vladimir Putin.  In fact, Farage has appeared regularly on Russian propaganda programs.  Now he's standing on the same stage as the Republican nominee.  Trump himself heaps praise on Putin and embrace pro-Russian policies.  He talks casually of abandoning our NATO allies, recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, and of giving the Kremlin a free hand in Eastern Europe more generally.  American presidents from Truman to Reagan have rejected the kind of approach Trump is taking on Russia.  We should, too.  All of this adds up to something we've never seen before.  Of course there's always been a paranoid fringe in our politics, steeped in racial resentment. But it's never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it, and giving it a national megaphone. Until now.  On David Duke's radio show the other day, the mood was jubilant.  "We appear to have taken over the Republican Party," one white supremacist said.  Duke laughed. There's still more work to do, he said.  No one should have any illusions about what's really going on here. The names may have changed Racists now call themselves "racialists." White supremacists now call themselves "white nationalists." The paranoid fringe now calls itself "alt-right." But the hate burns just as bright.  And now Trump is trying to rebrand himself as well. Don't be fooled.  There's an old Mexican proverb that says "Tell me with whom you walk, and I will tell you who you are."  We know who Trump is. A few words on a teleprompter won't change that.  He says he wants to "make America great again," but his real message remains "Make America hate again."  This isn't just about one election. It's about who we are as a nation.  It's about the kind of example we want to set for our children and grandchildren.  Next time you watch Donald Trump rant on television, think about all the kids listening across our country. They hear a lot more than we think.  Parents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the "Trump Effect."  Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.  At a recent high school basketball game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of "Build the wall!" and "Speak English."  After a similar incident in Iowa, one frustrated school principal said, "They see it in a presidential campaign and now it's OK for everyone to say this."  We wouldn't tolerate that kind of behavior in our own homes. How can we stand for it from a candidate for president?  This is a moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the Party of Lincoln has become the Party of Trump. It's a moment of reckoning for all of us who love our country and believe that America is better than this.  Twenty years ago, when Bob Dole accepted the Republican nomination, he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the Party to get out.  The week after 9/11, George W. Bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that Muslims "love America just as much as I do."  In 2008, John McCain told his own supporters they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat. Senator McCain made sure they knew -- Barack Obama is an American citizen and "a decent person."  We need that kind of leadership again.  Every day, more Americans are standing up and saying "enough is enough" -- including a lot of Republicans. I'm honored to have their support.  And I promise you this: with your help, I will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. For those who vote for me and those who don't.  For all Americans  Because I believe we are stronger together.  It's a vision for the future rooted in our values and reflected in a rising generation of young people who are the most open, diverse, and connected we've ever seen.  Just look at our fabulous Olympic team.  Like Ibtihaj Muhammad, an African-American Muslim from New Jersey who won the bronze medal in fencing with grace and skill. Would she even have a place in Donald Trump's America?  When I was growing up, Simone Manuel wouldn't have been allowed to swim in the same public pool as Katie Ledecky. Now they're winning Olympic medals as teammates.  So let's keep moving forward together.  Let's stand up against prejudice and paranoia.  Let's prove once again, that America is great because is America is good  Thank you, and may God bless the United States. Morning! I am so pleased to be here, I want to thank you all for the invitation, for the introduction, to everyone associated with NABJ and NAHJ, I want to just mark the moment because you were created in this hotel.  I don't know if there are any original founders, but if there are could you all stand up and we could give you some recognition?  I am delighted to thank you for the important work you do every day, and now more than ever we need you to keep holding leaders and candidates accountable. And in the tradition of path-breaking journalists like Ethel Payne and Ruben Salazar, we need you to make sure that America's front pages and nightly newscasts and online information reflects the great diversity of our nation.  Someone that I had the privilege of knowing, the late, great Bob Maynard, former owner of the Oakland Tribune, once said -- and I quote Bob -- "It is in seeing ourselves whole that we can begin to see ways of working out our differences of understanding our similarities,' and becoming a more cohesive nation.  And that is what you do every day, helping us to see ourselves as whole. You help us see ourselves whole.  I'm looking forward to our discussion, which I'm sure will cover a wide range of issues, but I want to take just a few minutes to focus on a challenge that doesn't get enough attention out on the campaign trail, although I've been trying, and that is: how do we expand economic opportunity for African Americans and Latinos across America?  And you know very well, it's been said that when the economy catches a cold, communities of color get pneumonia. The Great Recession hit our whole country hard, but the toll was especially difficult for black and Latino families. Black wealth was cut in half. For Latinos, it dropped 66 percent. That represented decades, even generations of hard work. And during these past 18 months, people across the country have described to me how hard it's been to get back on their feet in an economy that is still not working the way we all want to see it. And barriers of systemic racism makes that even harder.  Now I believe that President Obama does not get the credit he deserves for leading us out of the Great Recession, and I like to remind people he had nothing to do with creating it in the first place. He came into office and this worst-of-all-financial-crises-since-the-Great-Depression was handed to him. And I think if you fairly look at the record, you have to conclude that his leadership saved us from a Great Depression.  So as bad as things became -- 9 million jobs lost, 5 million homes lost, $13 trillion in family wealth wiped out -- as bad as it was, there's no telling how far down we would have gone without his leadership. So we are out of the ditch that we were in, and now we've got to do even more. We've got to build on the progress we've made. 15 million new jobs in the last seven years. 20 million people now have health insurance who did not have it before he became President.  So we've got to have the will and the plans together to move forward. That's why I've proposed a comprehensive new commitment to African American and Latino communities to make serious, sustained investments to create more good-paying jobs; to help families build and rebuild wealth; and support black- and Latino-owned small businesses. For me, these aren't just economic issues -- they're part of the long, continuing struggle for civil rights.  Rosa Parks opened up every seat on the bus. Now we've got to expand economic opportunity so everyone can afford the fare. And we have to make sure the bus route reaches every neighborhood, and connects families with safe, affordable housing and good jobs.  Sylvia Mendez and Ruby Bridges helped desegregate our schools. Now we've got to help every family afford the books, computers and internet access that our kids need to learn in the 21st century.  And so in my first 100 days as President, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. That includes jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small businesses, and infrastructure. If we invest in infrastructure now, we will not only create jobs today, we will lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.  We're going to also focus on creating jobs in communities where unemployment remains stubbornly high after generations of underinvestment and neglect. I'm a big fan of Congressman Jim Clyburn's "10-20-30' plan -- steering 10 percent of federal investment to neighborhoods where 20 percent of the population has been living below the poverty line for 30 years. We need that kind of focused, targeted investment -- in urban places, rural places -- wherever Americans have been left out and left behind.  We're also going to invest $20 billion in creating jobs for young people. There's a big gap here. The unemployment rate among Latino and African American youth is significantly higher than for whites. You know, it's hard to write a resume if you have nothing to put on it. We're going to help young people get that first job, so they can get that second job, so they can build a good solid middle-class life that will give them and their families a better future.  We're going to do more to help black and Latino entrepreneurs get access to capital, so they have a real chance at turning their ideas into thriving businesses. Now I think that's not only good for those entrepreneurs -- it's good for their families, their workers, and their communities.  Additionally, as part of our end-to-end reform of the criminal justice system, we're going to help people succeed when they return home from jail or prison. We're going to ban the box so they can be judged by their skills and talents, not by their past. And we will dedicate $5 billion to provide training and support to returning citizens so they can get good-paying jobs.  And in my first 100 days, I'm going to introduce legislation for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship -- that's not only the right thing to do. Every independent analysis shows it will add hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy. It will also keep families together. We need to bring hard-working people out of the shadows. America has always been a place where people from around the world work hard and apply their talents to American growth and innovation in pursuit of their own dreams. So we're going to do everything we can to get this done.  We need to build an economy and a future that every American can be proud of and be a part of. An economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That will be my mission as President.  These are just the highlights of our plan. I hope you'll go to my website, hillaryclinton.com to read the details, including how we're going to pay for everything I've proposed.  And of course I hope you'll compare that to what my opponent is talking about.  Here's one measure that you could use for that comparison: an independent economist recently calculated that, if my agenda for jobs and growth is put into place, our economy would create at least 10.4 million jobs within four years. We actually think it could be much more than that.  Now this economist also ran the numbers on Donald Trump, including his disastrous and inhumane plan to round up and deport millions of hard-working immigrants. The result, according to Mark Zandi, who was the economic advisor to John McCain during his 2008 run for the presidency, the result of Trump's plans would be a "lengthy recession' with 3.4 million jobs lost.  Now of course, Trump's problems go far beyond economics. At every turn, he stokes division and resentment. He says horrible things about one group of Americans after another. He's harkening back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the ugliest impulses of our society.  You know the list, you've reported on it. He started his campaign by describing Mexican immigrants as "criminals' and "rapists.' He retweets white nationalists. He says a distinguished judge can't be trusted because he is of Mexican heritage. He talks about banning Muslims from coming to the United States -- a land built on religious freedom. And yes, he also talks about curtailing press freedom as well.  We need to stand up as a country, and say Donald Trump doesn't represent who we are and what we believe. That is what my campaign, what Tim Kaine and I, and everyone supporting us, is doing every day. And we're going to keep at it. Because I believe with all my heart that America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump.  We just launched an all-Spanish Twitter account, because we want to bring as many Americans as possible into this conversation. We've opened offices in every state, because we want to compete everywhere -- we want to bring our message and our vision to all corners of our country.  But we can't do it alone. Everyone -- Republican, Democrat, and independent -- needs to stand up and speak out. And I think journalists have a special responsibility to our democracy in a time like this. As Ida B. Wells once said, "people must know before they can act, and there is no educator to compare to the press.'  Many of you are showing the way. It's a badge of honor when Jorge Ramos gets thrown out of a press conference for challenging Donald Trump. Or when another news organization gets banned for reporting what he says. As Jorge said, the best journalism happens when you take a stand, when you denounce injustice.  So I hope you'll keep calling it like you see it. Keep holding all of us accountable. I have laid out all these plans, and I'm well aware that I have been sometimes made fun of for putting out these plans about the economy and education and gun safety measures and all the rest of it. But I have this old fashioned idea that when you run for President, you ought to tell the voters of America what you would do as President. So I am going to keep telling you what I'm going to do because I want you to hold me accountable, press and citizens alike.  Because the stakes are as high as they've ever been in our lifetimes. And we all have to do our part.  So thank you for what you do everyday, thank you for inviting me to address you today. And I look forward to taking some of your questions today. Thank you all very much. It's great to be here with your governor. I am such a fan of Governor Hickenlooper for a lot of reasons, but one of the main reasons is because he does understand how we could create more jobs, and what's happened here in Colorado under his leadership proves that. And he has used his own experience as a small businessman who grew a business and was successful not to turn his back on what it took but to try to help more people get the tools they need to start those businesses, to grow those businesses. And what a stark contrast with Donald Trump who has spent his career stiffing small businesses, refusing to pay his bills to small businesses.  And I got to tell you, I take that really personally. My father was a small businessman, I mean really small nothing as successful as the governor's enterprises he printed fabrics to turn them into draperies and it was hard work. And I cannot imagine what it would have been like for my dad who stood at that long table and took a silk screen and put it down and then put paint into it, then took a squeegee and went across and then lifted it up and went down and went down over and over again and finally got the fabric printed, and then folded it up, and then loaded it into his car to take it to where it had been ordered from whether it was a restaurant, a hotel, any other business, an office building. I cannot image what that would have felt like for my father, a Navy veteran, a chief petty officer during World War II to have done his part, to have fulfilled his contract and then be told we're not going to pay you.  Now, when I first started hearing those stories about small businesses, I thought, well, maybe it happened once or twice. But no, my friends, it happened over and over again. Donald Trump would not pay people who did work, painters and plumbers and glass installers and marble installers and architects. We now have a very long list. What kind of man does business by hurting other people? I am just so, so determined that we are not going to let him do to America what he has done to so many other people.  I want to also recognize your congressman, Congressman Ed Perlmutter. Thank you, Ed, for being here. I want to thank your principal of this great high school, principal Thompson. Thank you. And I want to thank a great man from Colorado, someone I had the distinct honor of serving with in the United States Senate and then serving with in the Obama Administration, and that is Ken Salazar. I'll tell you, you will not find a better person, someone who is always thinking about what he can do to help somebody else, and I for one am grateful for his friendship.  Now, when I think about our convention last week did any of you see it? Well, what we tried to do was to make clear that we're not satisfied with where we are in the country, but we think we know how to make progress together. We think we can put into effect a jobs program that will create millions of new jobs with rising incomes, and here's what we're going to do. We're going to have the biggest infrastructure investment program since World War II. And if you look, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems, they're all in need. They all should be repaired. We have people who are driving long distances and spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars every year because of problems with the potholes or with the lack of maintenance. We have people scared about the bridges in their counties. They don't have much choice, but they shouldn't have to worry about whether they can get across or not. So we're going to make investments that will make America grow our economy, put people to work, and position us better to actually be competitive around the world. But there's a lot of infrastructure that you can't necessarily see that we want to work on. We need a modern electric grid that can take clean, renewable energy and distribute it everywhere across America.  And here's the other thing we need. We need to connect every community, no matter how isolated, how rural, how inner-city poor, no matter where it is, every community needs to be connected to broadband internet access.  This is a competitive issue. How are we going to help small businesses that don't have access? When I was in Pennsylvania a few days ago and I said that, I had a man tell me afterwards, he said, "Well, you have no idea how bad it is in rural parts of Pennsylvania. We still have dial up, and a lot of time that doesn't even work.' And then I told folks that I'd been talking to some teachers you know I love teachers and I'm going to support our teachers. But here is what the teachers told me. They said there had recently been a national survey asking teachers about different things they do in the classroom and the like, and 70 percent of teachers said that they assign homework to their students that requires the students to go on the internet. Now, I think that's great because we want our kids to be ready for the jobs of the future and that means they've got to understand how to learn and find information. But here's the rub: 5 million kids in America don't have access to internet in their homes. So you know what? We are leaving those kids behind while they're still in elementary and secondary schools. That is wrong. We're going to make sure America, which invented the internet, is the most connected country in the world.  And here's what else we're going to do: I'm going to support advanced manufacturing, manufacturing of all kinds. Because I believe that we've got a real opportunity to bring manufacturing back. I visited a place called Johnstown Wire Technologies in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. They started more than 100 years ago as a steel mill. Now they're making all kinds of wire products, and they're starting to bring jobs back from China to do that work in America.  Now, when Donald Trump is asked about where he makes things, he makes them anywhere else but America. His ties, his suits, his shirts, his furniture, his barware made all over the world. Bangladesh, Turkey, Slovenia, Mexico. And when asked about that, he said, well, we don't make that stuff in America. Well, I'm here to tell you: Donald, you're wrong.  And here's how I know. I know he's wrong because I've been collecting information and visiting places that actually do make these things in America. Just today I went to the Knotty Tie Company. And I met folks living right here in Denver who are making ties and scarves. I hope you like this one because I got it at Knotty just a few hours ago. I just got interviewed by one of the local newscasters, and first thing he said to me he didn't even know this was from Knotty he said, "That's a beautiful scarf.' He said, "That looks like it's got Colorado colors.' And in fact, one thing I really like about it, is printed right here on the scarf, it says "made in Colorado, not China.'  So I got so into this that we now have a website went public today called hillaryclinton.com/makeithere. And you can go on the website and you can see about 100 places around America where Donald could have made ties, shirts, suits, furniture, barware, right here in America. And I hope that more people will start making things here in America again.  So we are going to work to grow the economy, and I look often at Denver and Colorado as examples. And it's another one of the reasons why I admire your governor the transit system in Denver combined with the new airport connecting not only Denver to the airport, but other places in the region, is growing this economy. And very importantly, it's attracting a lot of young people who want to be able to quickly move from work to home to entertainment and everything else.  So we see this happening in lots of places. And so when people say to me, "Hey, we can't do that in America,' I say, "I don't know which America you've been looking at.' In fact, I couldn't figure out what country the Republican convention was talking about. A negative, pessimistic view of America that is not who we are. Do we have challenges? Sure. But can we meet them? Absolutely. We are truly stronger together, and that's what we're going to be doing. Now in addition to growing the economy, we've got to make it fairer. And I feel very strongly about this. We've got to make this economy work for everybody, not just those at the top.  So we are going to make these investments. We are going to invest more in education, starting with preschool education. We are going to train 50,000 teachers so that they can teach computer science in junior high and high school. We are going to make college debt free so that everybody can afford to go. And we're going to make community college free so you can get the skills you need for the jobs of today and tomorrow.  And I want to say something really serious about this. John and I have talked about this a lot. Look, I think it's great; everybody who wants to go to college should be able to afford to go to college. Anybody with student debt we're going to help you refinance the debt, because in America, if Donald Trump can plead bankruptcy six times and refinance his debts, American students and families ought to be able to refinance their debts.  But my friends, I do not believe that a four-year college education is the only path that we should have to a good job with a rising standard of living. That's why I want more technical education back in our high schools. That's why I want more apprenticeship programs in business and unions. I get very excited about this, because there are more than a million jobs right now waiting to be filled, by machinists and tool and die makers, by people with real skills coders who can get a good job. When I was at Johnstown Wire Technology, it's a unionized plant. U.S. Steelworkers represent that plant's workers. And they get some people already trained, and then the union and management train others. And the average salary is over $70,000 a year. We are also going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be living in poverty. And I'll tell you the fastest way we can raise incomes in America is to guarantee equal pay for women's work. And I am very I'm encouraged. When I started talking about this more than a year ago, I could see kind of quizzical looks out in the audience. And then I realized I've got to explain this is not just a woman's issue. If you have a working mother, wife, daughter, or sister, it's your issue.  You see, I get pretty excited about what we're going to do. I believe with all my heart that America's best years are still ahead of us. Now, that doesn't mean that I think it's going to be easy. But I know we're up to the job. I just know we are. I have no doubt about that. And we're also up to the responsibility of leading the world toward peace and prosperity as well. There is no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump is unqualified to be president and unfit to be commander-in-chief. Anyone who spends his time insulting our military, demeaning the service of our POWs and our fallen soldiers, insulting Gold Star families, this is not someone who understands the honor, the duty of serving America. I am so grateful to every single person who has ever put on the uniform of the United States military. And it worries me, some of what I hear him say. I mean, anyone who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near nuclear weapons.  And I want to I want to say a special word about something that's important here in Colorado. It's important in the West. And that is we have a responsibility to protect our public lands in America. The outdoor economy, the recreational economy is so important to so many places here in Colorado and elsewhere throughout the West. And I couldn't believe that Trump has basically gone along with what they put into the Republican platform that would disrupt and take back public lands that are really held in trust for all of us. So I want you to know as president, I will defend and protect America's public lands and our conservation.  So we're really having a good time in this campaign. And we want everybody to join. I said in my speech on Thursday night I want to be the president for all Americans: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I want to work for the struggling, the striving, and the successful. I want more people to be lifted up to follow their own dreams. So here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will join our campaign. And here in Colorado, if you text C-O to 47246, you can get involved or go to our website at hillaryclinton.com. And we are hiring organizers here in Colorado.  We are also setting a goal of registering three million more American citizens to vote in November. So make sure you're registered. Look for your mail ballot in October. And talk to your friends, your neighbors, your colleagues.  I believe that we are at a crossroads election. I've laid out the best I could, the specific plans and ideas that I want to pursue as your president because I have this old-fashioned idea. When you run for president, you ought to tell people what you want to do as their president. And I have also told you because I want you to hold me accountable. I will get up every single day and work hard for you and fight for you. And I will fight to preserve our rights, whether they are civil rights or human rights or women's rights or gay rights or voters' rights or workers' rights. And I will take on the gun lobby for common sense gun safety reform.  One of the one of the things I said Thursday night, which I will repeat here because I want you to know this, I do not want to repeal the Second Amendment. I do not want to take anyone's gun away. I just don't want you to get shot by somebody who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.  So we've got great work to do, and I'm excited about doing it with you because I do want you to know what I want to do as your president, to weigh that. It's like a big job interview. You're hearing from two people that you might hire. And I, frankly, think it's better for us to have an economy where you hear "You're hired,' instead of "You're fired.'  So, Colorado, let's get to work. Let's win in November. And let's make sure we build an American future that we all could be part of. Thank you, and God bless you. Thank you. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! Thank you. Thank you. I think you've made it pretty clear who you've come to hear, so I'll --In just a minute, I'm going to talk about my favorite subject, which is going to be what Hillary can and will do in the eight years following January 20th. But before that, there have been a couple of things said by Donald Trump in the last few weeks that I now, wait till you hear them, then you'll really boo.  So I'd like to clarify a little bit, and these are important points to be made and it's important that you hear the answer on them.  The first point was when he was asked about revealing his income tax returns, which every presidential candidate has done for 40 years. He said, "None of your business,' which did not go over so well. And then he started giving various explanations, and one of the explanations was that he had given his financial statement to the Election Commission, they're listed as assets and liabilities. But believe me, as someone who's filled out financial statements and someone who's filled out an income tax return, I can tell you they are two very different animals. And you will learn a whole lot more about Donald Trump if he produces his income tax return.  And so that's why I'd like to make him an offer an offer I hope he can't refuse. Donald Trump at one point he says various things at different times, but at one point, and I think he said it several times he said he can't do it, can't release it because he's under audit. Now, I've got news for him: I'm under audit too. And I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime between now and election. I will bring my tax return; he can bring his tax return. Nobody's going to arrest us. It is not there are no rules against showing your tax returns. And just let people ask us questions about the items that are on there.  How many of you would be afraid to have your tax return made public? Yeah, it is not no, no. You're only afraid if you've got something to be afraid about. And you're not he's not afraid because of what of the IRS. He's afraid because of you. So I will meet him in Omaha, or Mar-a-Lago, or he can pick the place anytime between now and election. I'll bring my return; he'll bring his return. We're both under audit. And believe me, nobody's going to stop us from talking about what's on those returns. And send the word to him, if you will.  Now, the another thing he said is he says America isn't great anymore. You know, you need him. But because America just isn't great anymore. Now, everybody is entitled to their opinion. I disagree with him violently on that subject, which I'll say a little bit about more later. But it's how he explains what he would do about that, because I'm going to quote his exact words I'm going to read this because I want to be sure I've got it exactly right. He says, "No one knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.' Well, la-dee-da. You know? I mean, this is only he can fix it. I didn't really realize we were in such grave danger. I mean, there's 325 million Americans, and if this guy leaves for Canada, it's supposed to be hopeless for the rest of us. No, he alone can fix it. It takes some kind of nerve, or something else, to really have the notion that out of 325 million people, you're the only one who can fix it.  Now, I think when somebody makes a statement like that, you should look at his record when he has appealed to the American public before. Now, Donald Trump has been in a lot of businesses, he's had a lot of bankruptcies, but usually that's just involved borrowing money from the American public. But in 1995 to my knowledge it's the only time Donald Trump went to the American people and he said, "Join me 'm a winner. Join me and invest in my company,' Trump hotels and casino resorts. It's the only time he asked the public to join, but now you got a chance to join the great man in this investment. That was in 1995. They listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and Mr. Trump very modestly made the ticker symbol DJT. Guess what that's for? So he names the company after himself, or he gets the ticker symbol after himself. In the next 10 years, the company loses money every year every single year. The he takes out $44 million in compensation during that period.  If you in 1995, when he offered this company, if a monkey had thrown a dart at the stock page, the monkey on average would have made 150 percent. But the people that believed in him, that listened to his siren song, came away losing well over 90 cents on the dollar. They got back less than a dime. And you know the history of his enterprises where he was borrowing money where one time after another, he went into bankruptcy. I've really never known another businessman that brags about his bankruptcies. I mean, and itto tell you the truth, why not? I mean, it's his claim to stardom. I don't know anybody else that's had six bankruptcies, but there he is.  Now, the final straw occurred this weekend, and you know about it. Donald Trump managed to get in front of George Stephanopoulos after Mr. and Mrs. Khan had told about their Gold Star son, and Mr. Khan had offered him a Mr. Trump a copy of the Constitution. And Donald Trump said this when asked by George Stephanopoulos about --"Well, Mr. Khan first said you have sacrificed nothing and no one.' Quite an accurate statement. And Trump said, "I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I've worked very, very hard. I've created thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've had tremendous success.' And George, a little overcome, said, "Those are sacrifices?' And Trump, believe it or not, said, "Oh, sure. I think they're sacrifices.'  Now, the young son of Mr. and Mrs. Khan died a dozen or so years ago. In that dozen of years, we've employed a lot of people. I've had fun doing it. We've made money just like Donald Trump has made. I have made no sacrifice. No member of my family has gone no member of the Buffett family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan. No member of the Trump family has gone to Iraq or Afghanistan. We've both done extremely well during this period, and our families haven't sacrificed anything, and Donald Trump and I haven't sacrificed anything. But how in the world can you stand up to a couple of parents who have lost a son and talked about sacrificing because you were building a bunch of buildings?  I mean, that is when I heard that, my mind went back and this goes back before most of you were born but they went back to the McCarthy hearings. And at the time of the McCarthy hearings at the time of the Senate McCarthy hearings with the Army, Joe Welch had a young assistant of his maligned by Senator McCarthy, and McCarthy went on and on, and implying this guy was a communist and doing all kinds of things. And finally Joe Welch couldn't take it anymore and he said, and I'll quote him, "Have you no sense of decency, sir?' And I ask Donald Trump, have you no sense of decency, sir?  I might add I'd just add one thing. McCarthy's career went straight downhill after that.  Let's move on to more pleasant subjects. Unlike what Mr. Trump says, America is great. Yes. So let's talk about the USA. Because 240 years ago, we started with a piece of paper. It was a blueprint for a new society a society unlike anything the world had ever seen before. And in 1776, that blueprint started us on a path that has finally led to the next woman president. It was imperfect, but it was aspirational.  Now, that blueprint has done wonders for this country in terms of overall prosperity. When I was born in 1930, if my parents had seen what the world would look like in 2016, they wouldn't have believed it. The GDP per capita is six times what it was when I was born. That's never happened in the history of mankind. It's a miracle. And the miracle is America. And it still has all the qualities that it had in 1930, and which propelled us forward like this.  So America, in terms of delivering wealth, has been incredible. In terms of distributing wealth, it has not been living up to what I consider its potential. I just described to you $56,000 of GDP per capita, and that means a family of four, on average, would have $224,000 of GDP per capita. But it hasn't worked out that way. This country, while making some people enormously wealthy, has left people behind. And those people were just a willing, probably more willing, to go to Afghanistan.  And in Hillary Clinton, you have somebody that cares about that. Let me give you just one more statistic and I'll get away from that. I know how popular that is. But in the first year of the Forbes 400 back in the 1980s, the aggregate wealth of the 400 was $93 billion. You can look it up on the internet. Currently, it's $2,374,000,000. That's 25 for 1. Now, I'd like everybody that's had 25 for 1 themselves, if they'd raise their hand. Yeah. It hasn't happened. They told us it would trickle down. Yeah.  But what has happened what has happened is it's flooded upward. And that almost $2.4 trillion, from 400 people in this country, they're not bad people. I know a good many of them. I'd like to know more, actually. But they have benefitted from the system that, frankly, tilted toward people like me and the rest of that group. I mean, it's not because they're evil, but they've taken advantage. They're the ones with the lobbyists. They're the ones that come up with carried interest where their income is taxed at rates far lower than almost all of the people in this room.  And it's going to take somebody with strength, resoluteness, brains, energy it's going to take that to somebody to effect change. I mean, there's no question about that. It won't happen by itself. It takes guts. It is a tough, tough job when you try and change the code on people that are making millions and billions of dollars a year in order to give a better break to the people who work just as hard, maybe harder, and take home a few hundred dollars a week. It's really wrong that in a country where there's $56,000 of GDP per person for anybody that works 40 hours a week not to be able to rely on a decent living for their family. It just doesn't make any sense.  And it won't cure itself, and it certainly won't be cured with Donald Trump. It's going to take Hillary Clinton. It's going to take powers of persuasion. It's going to take a mandate from the people in their election. But she's spelling out what she's going to do, as contrasted to one of the other candidates. She is telling you what she is going to do about the tax code. And when that gets enacted, I'll be a little worse off, and believe me, I can take it. And you'll be better off.  Now I'd like to make a little news. And this is a surprise even to Hillary. It's very easy there were 129 million votes cast in the last presidential election. It's very easy to think, if you're watching a TV show or the weather's a little bad or something, to think, well, my vote really doesn't count. What difference is it going to make with 129 million? Well, I've got some real news for you. It doesn't make much difference if you're a Democrat in Idaho or a Republican in California. I mean, you are in a state where the electoral vote's going to be decided by majority vote, and you're on the short side in that case.  But we live in a very special place. In Nebraska and Maine, we also cast electoral votes by congressional district, and we don't have to think about 129 million popular votes throughout the country; we have to think about 538 electoral votes. And yesterday on that same George Stephanopoulos show they had four people predicting how the election would come out. And Jonathan Karl of ABC News had gone state by state and come up with he came up with his notion as to who was going to carry each state and how that would cause the electoral vote to come out. And those of you who watched the show yesterday saw that he came out 269 to 269. He absolutely said that he did not try to come out that way, he just looked state by state 269 to 269. Now, there's one district in the United States I am looking at the people that can change that 269 to 270. It happened in 2008 by 3,200 or 3,325 votes by this. We actually gave a vote separate than the rest of Nebraska. So it's been done. It's been done.  But we're going to help that process along this time. I have pledged today that on Election Day, November 8th, I will take at least 10 people to the polls who would otherwise have difficulty getting there. And when you go home tonight, you can go to a website called Drive2 that's for the 2nd Congressional District, it's the number 2 Drive2Vote, and if you go there, it will offer you information on three things: how to register; how, if you need a ride on November 8th, you may find someone who will take you, will take care of that; and it'll also give you the chance to volunteer to take some people, whether it's 10 or a lesser number. Today, I reserved Ollie the Trolley for November 8th. It seats 32. I'm going to be on it all day. I'm going to do selfies whatever it takes. And if it's snowing, if it's cold, my goal and the goal of the people who've joined me on this in this drive to vote my goal is to have the turnout in Douglas-Sarpy Counties, the 2nd District, is to have the turnout here be the highest percentage of potential voters of any district in the country. Let's Let's give America a civics lesson. How about it? Everybody in the 2nd District, yeah? And if the people in this room, each one of you would pledge to take 10 people, that I can almost guarantee that'll be the march of the victory.  So join me. If you can take 20, do that. If you can only take three or four, that's fine too. But get that neighbor who is watching that television program or [] and shame him into coming with you to the polls. Now, just remember, Drive2Vote. Okay.  Now, if you've read the Constitution, which apparently some people haven't if you read Article II, it deals with the presidency. Article II of the Constitution, look it up. That's where they describe the presidency. We wrote that Constitution; 39 men signed it. How would you ever guess? You'll find out in a minute. Thirty-nine men signed it, and in Article II, describing the qualifications for the president of the United States, male pronouns --"he,' "his' and "him' were used 20 times. Just imagine that. And it's still in the Constitution 227 years later. "He,' "his' and "him.' No "hers,' no "shes.' Well, on January 20th, we're going to elect the best president we've ever had, and somebody is going to change those pronouns: Hillary Rodham Clinton!"  HILLARY CLINTON:  "Wow! Thank you. Thank you all so much. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Omaha. Thank you. Thank you, Congressional District 2. I am so delighted to be back here with so many friends and supporters, and with everyone here today. And especially, I want to thank Warren Buffett for that kind and generous introduction. I've heard Warren called the Omaha Oracle. I call him my friend. He is an American original. I am honored to have his support, and I love the idea that together all of you are going to aim to have the highest percentage turnout of any congressional district in America.  It's great to be here at the North High School the Magnet School. I had a chance to say hello to your principal, Gene Haynes. And I see scattered throughout the crowd both students and teachers, and I love teachers. Thank you. I also wanted to thank a former colleague of mine in the United States Senate, your former Senator, Ben Nelson. I have to tell you, I've had the best week. Any of you watch the convention? I was so excited to have the opportunity for so many people who care about our country, who have contributed in many different ways, to have a chance to stand before America, and to tell their stories. Because America is story after story. And what I want is to provide the opportunity and the support so that every single American can live his or her best story, can make the most of your own God-given potential.  And after the convention was over, starting Friday morning, Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne and Bill and I got on a bus and started traveling across Pennsylvania, into Ohio; we visited factories, small towns, bigger cities. We met with so many hard-working people who told us their stories. And they proved every day that Donald Trump is wrong. America is not weak. I agree with Warren. This is the greatest nation on earth, and our best days are still ahead of us.  Now, that doesn't mean we don't have challenges and problems. Of course we do. Right here at home and around the world. But I don't believe there is anything that Americans can't do if we make up our minds, because, you know why? We are stronger together. But as Warren said, too many people haven't gotten a raise since the great crash. There's too much inequality and too little opportunity. Washington is paralyzed by special interests and big money. But don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes if we make up our minds to solve our problems. And don't believe anyone who tells you, "I alone can fix it.'  When Donald Trump said that in his convention speech, I did a bit of a mental double take. I listened to that speech, 75 minutes of it, and it was like he was talking about a different country. Forgetting about everyone in America who gets up every day and works together. People who make a difference every single day. He's forgetting our troops on the front lines, he's forgetting police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. He's forgetting about doctors and nurses who save lives, and teachers who change lives. He's forgetting about unions who fight for working families, and communities that pull together through hard times.  I grew up in the Midwest. I was born in Chicago, raised outside of Chicago. My dad was a small businessman. I mean, really small. It was mostly just him and occasionally my mother, my brothers, and me. And sometimes he'd hire helpers to get one of his orders out, because he printed fabrics to be made into draperies. And he had a print plant with long tables. He was a very self-reliant man. But I don't think he, for a minute, through his growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, through his service as a chief petty officer in the Navy, through his work in business or his raising our family, ever thought to himself, "I alone can fix it.'  That's just not the way we were raised. We were raised to get together. We were raised to follow up on the extraordinary example of our founders 240 years ago, in Philadelphia, who came together. You see that across Nebraska. You see people working. I've been in Omaha. I have visited projects, schools, other kinds of nonprofits and institutions where people are working together. That's what we do in America. We see a problem and we say, "We'll fix it together.' And that's what we're going to do when we get the White House to move us forward in the direction we need to go.  Now, I know how hard the great recession was. It was a terrible time. The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And people in Nebraska worked hard to come back. I think it was a terrible moment. It could've gotten even worse. I believe that a lot of difficult decisions had to be made. And we have come back from that terrible financial crisis. Thanks to the hard work of Nebraskans, Americans, and President Obama, we got out of the ditch we were in. So I think if we're going to solve the problems we have, we ought to be really clear about where we've come from. We now have 15 million new jobs that have been created in the last 7 ½ years. We now have 20 million more Americans who have access to healthcare. We have the highest percentage ever in our history of young people walking across graduation stages to get their high school diplomas.  So I know we've made progress, but I know we shouldn't be satisfied. As Americans, we always have to be asking ourselves, what can we do better? How can we make more progress? How can we help more people? We're still facing tough challenges that developed long before the recession, and they've stayed with us. The economy is not working the way it should for everyone. Starting in Iowa back in April 2015, until the convention this week, I have met so many people who tell me, you know, they don't expect a handout. They don't even expect, you know, life to be easy. But they don't think it should be this hard.  It shouldn't be that people feel like they're out there on their own, like no one cares about them, that they're not respected. That the dignity of their job is not something that we all support. I know a lot of people who feel that way. I bet there are some in this gymnasium who feel that way. Well, here's what I want you to know: You deserve a president who will get up every single day in the White House and do everything she can to give you the chance you deserve to have.  And I will quickly add, as important as it is to have someone who gets what you're going through, I think it's also really important that that person tells you what her plans are for producing results. So if you saw what I said on Thursday night, let me give you the short, punchier version. And it starts by making clear, we do have to rewrite the rules so that our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. My overriding mission as president will be to do everything I can to help our country create more jobs with rising income. I believe anyone willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to support a family.  So in my first 100 days, we are going to break through the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We are going to make the boldest investment in American infrastructure since the highway system. Warren read you some of the quotes from Donald Trump. Well, he has said so many things that I profoundly, vehemently disagree with. And for the life of me, I don't know why someone runs to be president of the United States who thinks and says, we never win anymore. Our country is full of losers. Well, he could not be more wrong. We are going to fix and build the roads, the bridges, the tunnels, the ports, the airports, the water systems we need.  And I want to say a particular word to any of you here from rural Nebraska. We're going to bring diverse economic development to rural communities to support our farmers and others in small towns who keep America going. And one specific way we will do that is to make sure we have an electric grid that can take and distribute energy from clean, renewable sources. In fact, I know, because I've seen them in the crowd, there are a few people from Iowa here today. And your neighbor Iowa is already getting one third of its electricity from clean energy, primarily wind energy. And what I love about that is, they're also giving farmers extra income for hosting the turbines on their farm, and they are taking abandoned factories and actually assembling the wind turbines, putting people to work in Iowa to produce the energy in Iowa.  The other thing we're going to do is finish the job of building out broadband so everybody in America, no matter where you live, has access to the Internet. I don't know how we build a 21st-century economy for our young people if we don't give every home and business access to high-speed Internet connectivity. And I learned something from talking to some of my teacher friends as I said, I do love teachers, and I'm going to work with you to support you.  And here's what they told me. They told me that a recent survey found 70 percent of our teachers give homework assignments to their students that require them to use the Internet. Now, that makes perfect sense. We want to have a really great opportunity for young people to understand how to be involved with and use the Internet. But here's the rub. We have 5 million kids in America who don't have access to the Internet in their homes. So already they're being left out and left behind. We don't have a child to waste. We need every child to be given an education to prepare them for the future.  So, to me, it's real simple. If we invest in infrastructure, we're going to put millions of people to work, and we're going to lay the foundation for new jobs in the future. The second thing we're going to do is invest in American manufacturing. And here's why. A lot of people say, you know, we can't make things in America anymore. And they think about all of the jobs we've lost because of low wage labor and other problems. Well, here's what I have seen and I've seen it all over America I was just in a plant in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. A wire plant called Johnstown Wire Technologies.  And I was talking it's a plant that's been there more than 100 years. Started off as a steel plant. Now it's making wire products. And I was talking to them, and I said, well, what kind of future do you think you have? And they said, boy, if we get the right support, we've got a great future. We're actually bringing jobs back from China to Johnstown, Pennsylvania. When I was your Secretary of State, I visited 112 countries, and I went to a lot of places that really want American-made products. They're the best, the most innovative. Nobody can outwork or outcompete American workers or American businesses.  So what I want to do I want to support manufacturers, large and small. And again, I hear Trump talking a big game about I think he says, putting America first. Well, I don't know what part of "America first' leads him to make Trump furniture in Turkey, not Nebraska. Or Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Or Trump barware in Slovenia, not Ohio. He says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again.  And then just this week we find out he's asking for permission to get visas to bring more foreign workers, which he has used consistently, to work in his country clubs, on his golf courses. And he was asked, I think, on that same interview Warren was talking about he goes, oh, well, it's very hard to find people. Well, I bet together we could find thousands of people who would like to work at a country club or on a golf course in America.  We're also going to take seriously the education and training of our young people, and people in midcareer. We're going to invest in STEM education, which is part of the mission here. I want us to provide to every student in America the chance to learn computer science like you're doing here at OmahaNorth High School. We are going to partner with the private sector to train up to 50,000 computer science teachers over the next decade, so they're in the classroom preparing our young people. We're also going to make college tuition free for the middle class, and debt-free for everybody.  And we will liberate millions of people who already have student debt. It is just not fair that Donald Trump takes bankruptcy six times to get out from under his debts, and we won't let families and students refinance their student debt. And here's something else. I don't think we say this enough. College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America. Right now, there are millions of job openings. We don't have enough machinists or welders or coders. We need more skilled people in the trades because a lot of the people who know how to do that work are going to be retiring in the next 10 or 15 years. That's why I want to support more business and union apprenticeship initiatives, targeted higher education programs, more training. We're going to help people build a better future.  And, finally, we are going to support the kind of small businesses that Donald Trump has consistently stiffed. Like I said, my dad was a very small businessman. I take this really personally. I had no idea before he started running and information began coming to light what he has done to hurt people. I said in the convention Atlantic City, New Jersey, hardworking contractors, small businesses, were left holding the bag after Trump refused to pay their bills. I'm talking about painters, landscapers, plumbers, the people who installed the glass in his casino, the people who laid the marble floor in his casino. They needed the money. They did the work. They bought the supplies. And he didn't pay them, not because he couldn't but because he wouldn't. That is just not the way you do business in America. We make good on our promises.  Well, I think about my dad standing over those big bolts of fabric. You take a silkscreen. You put it down. You pour paint in it. You take a squeegee. You go from one side to the other. Then you lift it up, and you keep going down the table. Then maybe you come back, and you add another color with a different silkscreen. And then, finally, you finish.  My dad would get contracts. He would do the work. Then he would load the fabrics into his car, and he would take them to the places that had ordered them: hotels, offices, restaurants. And he expected to be paid. If one of his major customers had refused, he would have been forced to close up his business. Luckily, he never had a contract with Donald Trump. If you hire someone to do a job and they do it, you pay them. You don't go around bullying small businesses just because you can.  Small businesses are the backbone of this economy. And I want to be a small business president. We're going to make it easier to give credit, to cut red tape. Too many dreams still die in the parking lots of banks in America. If you can dream it, you should be able to build it.  I also will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for everything I have proposed. If you go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, you can see. It's not complicated. It's exactly what Warren said, "Follow the money.' And I'm glad I'm glad Warren is so good-humored about it because the super-rich, Wall Street and corporations, are going to start paying their fair share for supporting the United States of America. And this is not because this is not because we resent success. We welcome success as long as you do it fairly and don't abuse people on the way up. But 90 percent of the income gains have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent in America. Our tax code is full of loopholes and special breaks that make it even worse.  And what I really appreciate about Warren is he has said and he has said it consistently he should never be able to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. And he is right. So I have said I am going to follow Warren's example. Being successful doesn't have to come at the expense of others. He knows that real value comes from helping more people invest in themselves. Their businesses grow the economy. And so we're going to use him and his ideas about how we're going to tax the wealthy more as the real foundation of making the investments in America that will help everybody.  Now, I don't 'm told that Donald Trump stays glued to the TV set. So I hope he heard Warren. There's always there's always time for a conversion because while Warren is standing up for a fairer tax code, Trump wants to cut taxes for the super-rich. Well, we're not going there, my friends. I'm telling you right now we're going to write fairer rules for the middle class, and we aren't going to raise taxes on the middle class.  And while we're at it, we would like to see those tax returns, wouldn't we? My husband and I have put out I think about 33 or 34 years' worth if you're interested. He doesn't even respect the American people enough to do what every other presidential candidate has done for decades and release them. It's time for Trump to stop hiding. It's time to stand up for working families. It's time to make clear that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And that's what we're going to get back to doing.  So, my friends, I will not rest until we get wages and incomes rising. I will not rest until we make it clear what's at stake in this election. And that's why I need your help. I just want to I want to throw into the challenge that Warren made if this congressional district has the highest percentage of votes in any congressional district and, of course, if I win, here's what we'll do. I will shortly after I become president, sometime as soon as I can arrange it, come back here. And Warren and I will dance [] together. And maybe if we're really lucky, he'll wear his Elvis costume again.  Please join this campaign. Text JOIN, J-O-I-N. Go to 47246. Go to hillaryclinton.com. And, oh, by the way, we are hiring organizers in Nebraska. So let's have some fun. Let's register voters. Let's turn people out. And let's win this election for America's future. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you all! Thank you! I got to tell you, it is so great, so great being back here with you. I am excited about our bus trip, which started in Philadelphia, and we've gone across Pennsylvania, and now we're in the great state of Ohio, starting in the Mahoning Valley! I apologize for us being late. We ran into a lot of thunderstorms, and it slowed us down. I really appreciate all of you waiting. It means the world to us to be here with you tonight. And there's a big overflow crowd, and I understand they can hear us, and I want to thank them for being here as well.  I want to thank Glenn Johnson and Robert Morales for being up here to introduce us to the stage. I am very proud to have the support and the endorsement of the UAW. I'm also very pleased to see our long-time friend, your former governor, Ted Strickland, a decent, hard-working, committed man who I hope you will send to the United States Senate in November. I appreciate State Senator Joe Schiavoni, and Joe, we do want that pizza. We need that pizza.  And finally, I got to tell you, I am just the biggest fan of your congressman, Tim Ryan. How many of you saw him speak at the Democratic Convention? Wasn't he terrific? Tim and I have a lot in common. I started the Manufacturing Caucus in the Senate when I was there. He has led the House of Representatives Manufacturing Caucus. We are both commit to bringing manufacturing back so that there is a real path to the middle class for people who help to actually make things in America again.  Tim and I also share a love for hot sauce. And he told me there would be one up here, but Tim, somebody got to it. It's gone. So I'm going to hold you to it. I understand there's kind of a special hot sauce that's made right here. Right? Hot peppers! [] Yes, I want to try that. I told Tim some years ago that when Bill ran for President in 1992, I read an article which said that if you ate hot peppers, it would build your immune system. I figured, well, it's worth a try. I started heating hot peppers back in '92. I'm still eating them. And I'm still standing. And I'm still ready to go to the White House!  Now, we're on this bus tour to highlight what our plans are to create more good jobs and raise incomes. And we wanted to come to Pennsylvania and Ohio because these are two states where people still make things, where people believe that it's possible to be a builder, to make a contribution, to have a good life for your family. So we've been visiting factories. We've been talking to folks, getting ideas. And here's what I think. I think that if you agree that our major challenge economically is to create more good-paying jobs with rising incomes and good benefits so that more people in America right here in the Mahoning Valley, across Ohio, and across our country have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead, which is the basic bargain of America that joined this campaign.  I started that Manufacturing Caucus back in the Senate because I represented New York. And in Upstate New York some of you know because you may have traveled through there we had a lot of hard-working people who got caught up in technology, with automation, with jobs being moved out of our country. And they deserved better. And we began to put together plans, and that's exactly what I will do as your president. We're going to have the biggest job creation program since World War II. And we're going to invest in infrastructure, we're going to build and maintain our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. There is so much good work to be done in America. And it's not just what we can see; not just the physical infrastructure, which is critically important. We need a new electric grid. If we're going to be creating renewable energy, we've got to be able to distribute it. We need to make sure every person, every home, every business in America has access to broadband. Internet connectivity that will give them a chance to compete and win in the economy.  I said in Harrisburg Pennsylvania last night that that's what I wanted to do, and I told folks that teachers had told me, just recently, there was a big national survey of teachers and you know I love teachers. And so these teachers that were telling me that after they did this survey, they found that about 70 percent of our nation's teachers assign homework that requires kids to use the Internet. And I see some teachers' heads nodding. Well, that makes perfect sense because we want our kids prepared for the future. They're going to live in the information age, and goodness knows, it's going to be moving even faster.  That's the good news. The bad news is, there are 5 million kids in America who cannot access the Internet from their homes when they're supposed to be doing their homework. And there are parts of every state because when I finished speaking last night, I went out, as I will later, and meet everybody, shake your hands and some of the people there told me, they said, you have no idea how bad it is in places in Pennsylvania. We still have dial-up. A lot of places, we can't get access. That is unacceptable. It is 2016. We are going to finish providing broadband Internet connectivity to every place in America.  We are also going to invest in advanced manufacturing. I can't wait until I get to work with Tim Ryan and Ted Strickland and Sherrod Brown about how we're going to do this. We're going to invest, we're going to work the public and the private sectors to make sure, number one, that businesses get the support they need in order to have the kind of plant and equipment that will enable them to be more competitive. We are going to make sure that people have the skills that they can immediately put to work.  I am a strong believer is that, yes, it's great to get a four year college education, and we're going to make that debt free. But I don't believe that a four year college education should be the only path for people having a good middle class job, and a future that gives them and their kids better opportunities. We were in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and we were meeting with the management and the Steelworkers Union, a unionized plant, and they helped to train their people. And then their workers are making, on average, $70,000 a year. I'm telling you, we can do this. Because there are now million jobs in America that are not being filled. We don't have enough machinists, tool and die workers, welders, coaters. We need more skilled people in the trades. I've got a plan to encourage businesses to pay to train people, and to support union apprenticeship programs so that we get those skills and get ready to make a good future.  And, you know, I believe strongly that some nation is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I want it to be us. Because there are millions of new jobs and businesses if we do this. So we are going to grow the economy. I'm going to invest $10 billion in manufacturing communities like those in the Mahoning Valley. And I'm going to do it by defending American workers. We are not going to let Republican governors and Republican legislatures undermine the right to join a union, undermine the right to bargain collectively. I believe Right to Work is wrong for America, and I will stand against that effort.  And we are going to say no to unfair trade deals. I'm going to appoint a special trade prosecutor to go after companies and countries that undercut our businesses and are unfair to our workers. We're going to enforce rules of origin. We saved the American auto industry from a certain demise. And I'll tell you, it was the Democrats who did it, wasn't it? And it was the right thing to do. The American auto industry just had its best year ever last year. Well, we're going to keep that going. And the way we are is, we're going to stand up for our companies and our workers, and we're not going to let China continue to dump cheap steel into the American market.  Another way we're going to grow the economy is by supporting small business. You heard Tim say his dad was a small businessman. So was mine. My father had a small business that printed fabric for draperies. He had a what we called a print plant. It was a kind of low ceilinged, kind of dark place in Chicago, with two really long tables. And the way you did this because I helped him when I had to, and he needed the help you would take the fabric, you'd put it on the long table, then you'd take what's called a silkscreen, and you'd put it down, and then you'd take the paint you'd pour it into the silkscreen, then you'd take the squeegee and you'd go from left to right, then you'd lift it up and you'd keep going down the table.  I know how hard he worked. And I know how many opportunities that hard work gave my family. That's why I take really personally what Donald Trump does to small businesses. This is not just a campaign talking point. This is personal. You know, because my dad did all that work he would get contracts, he'd load the fabrics into the car, then he'd take them he'd provide them to the hotel or the restaurant, the office and then he expected to be paid. I mean, that's the way we do business, isn't it? I mean, my first job is I babysat. I expected to be paid. Every job I've had since, I expected to be paid after I did the job.  Well, apparently Donald Trump thinks he's immune from all of those rules and requirements. And so, person after person has come forward to say the same thing: I got the contract, I did the work, he wouldn't pay me. I'm talking about plumbers and painters, glass installers, marble installers, all kinds of people. And then what happens is, you know, they do the work, they go to get paid he or his minions say, no, we're not going to pay you. And, you know, it's a kind of like, a shock what do you mean you're not going to pay me? They say, if you don't like it, go sue us. Well, if you're a small business person, you can't afford to sue a guy who puts his name on big buildings all over the place, has a battalion of lawyers. This man has been sued 3,500 times. He plays the odds. "A lot of people won't sue me. A lot of people will give up if they try. So maybe at the end we'll have to pay them 50 cents, 30 cents on the dollar.' That is so wrong, and it is something it is something that people who have been treated like this are coming to the forefront to speak out about. Because, you know what? They don't want America being treated by Donald Trump the way they were treated by Donald Trump.  I looked it up: nearly 98 percent of businesses in Ohio are small business. So again, I take this personally. We're going to help small business. We're going to help get you more access to credit, cut red tape, remove obstacles so that small businesses can thrive. But we're not only going to grow the economy, we're going to make the economy fairer. Because the economy needs to work for everybody, not just those at the top. And we need to be doing everything we can to lift more people up. So we're going to raise the national minimum wage. We're going to make it a living wage that can produce a good, solid, middle-class life.  And the fastest way to increase family incomes is to make sure women get paid for the work that we do. Now, I'll tell you, this is not a woman's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a working mother, wife, daughter, or sister, it's your issue. And so therefore, finally, we're going to put this right.  So I'm excited about what we're going to do to create jobs, raise incomes, grow the economy, make it fair. And we're going to pay for everything, I'm telling you, and I'm telling you how I'm going to pay for it. It's pretty simple. We're going to increase taxes on corporations, Wall Street, and the wealthy in America.  Now, that is not because I'm against success. We don't resent success in America. But it's because that's where the money is. 90 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of Americans. So it's like that movie. You want to know what we're going to do? We're going to Follow the Money, and the money leads to the super wealthy and corporations and Wall Street, who need to be paying for the benefits that they have received from living in the greatest country in the world.  So as you can tell, I'm pretty excited. It may be late, but I'm really jazzed up about what we're going to do. And I don't think the stakes could be higher. Tim told you some of the reasons why Donald Trump is offering empty promises and totally at odds with what he's done in business, how he's treated people. Well, let's just take one more example. He talks about let's make America great, right? Well, he talks about putting America first, right? Well, then why does he make Trump suits in Mexico instead of Brooklyn, Ohio? Why does he make furniture in Turkey instead of Cleveland? Why does he make barware in Slovenia instead of Jackson, Ohio?  Well, if you saw your great senator, Sherrod Brown, at the Democrat convention he was great. He said he bought his suit not far from where he lives in Cleveland, bought his tie in Ohio, bought his shirt in Ohio. Now, I don't want to stir up any rivalry with Pennsylvania but my husband is wearing a shirt that was made in Reading, Pennsylvania. So if we're going to make America great again, Donald Trump ought to start making things in America again.  This is going to be a very intense campaign, right? One hundred days from today, people are going to go vote. Tim and Ann and Bill and I and everyone working with us, we're going to work our hearts out, because I have to tell you this is not a normal election. Donald Trump is not a normal presidential candidate. Somebody who attacks everybody has something missing. I don't know what it is. I'm not going to get into that. But yesterday he attacked a distinguished Marine general, John Allen. He attacked the distinguished father of a soldier who sacrificed himself for his unit, Captain Khan. He's attacked immigrants and women. He's attacked people with disabilities. It's a long list, my friends. I don't know, maybe he doesn't have anything positive to say.  But when you run for president, it's kind of like a giant job interview. If you were interviewing somebody to hire and that person came in to see you and that person spent all of his time insulting and scapegoating and blaming other people, and then got up and left your office, you'd be kind of wondering what does that person do. I think it is fair to say he is temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief. And as I said Thursday night, someone who can get provoked by a tweet should not be responsible for nuclear weapons.  So here's what I'm asking you. We're going to be back. We'll be in the Mahoning Valley. We'll be all over Ohio. Because I want people to understand what the choice is and how it will affect you, your job, your future. And just yesterday, the Republican economist who advised Senator John McCain when he ran for president in 2008, he looked at the plans that I've put forth and he's looked at what Donald Trump has said he wants to do, and here's what he concluded: Under my plans, America will create at least 10 million new jobs in the first four years. And this is not me saying it. This is not me saying it. It's not even a Democrat saying it. But then he goes on and says under Trump's plans America will lose 3.5 million jobs. So this is serious business. Yes, don't boo. Vote.  So here's what I'm asking. I am asking for your help in this campaign. I want you to talk to your friends, your neighbors, your family members. I know that there are people here in the Mahoning Valley who think they want to support Trump. I just want you to try to have a conversation with them. I want you to ask them please to look at the facts. I want you to ask them to look at the stories that are coming out in the press every day about people who were stiffed, mistreated. I want you to look at the stories of all the foreign workers that he hires. I want you to look at where he makes the things he sells. And then I want you to ask your friends and neighbors, "Is this somebody who really cares about the people of the Mahoning Valley, the people of this great state?'  And I want you to join the campaign. Here's what you can do: Text JOIN, J-O-I-N, to 47246 or go to hillaryclinton.com. And by the way, we are hiring organizers in Ohio, so if you're interested, go to hillaryclinton.com and look for where we're hiring, because we are going to reach out. We're going to register 3 million more people. We are going to turn everybody out to vote.  Because like I said, I want you to know what my plans are as your president and I want you to hold me accountable. I'm not going to sit in the White House. I'm going to keep traveling around America. I'm going to come back to the Mahoning Valley. I'm going to sit down; I'm going to ask you what's working, what's not working. As you heard in the convention, when I tell you I will try to help you, you can count on it, because I will do everything I possibly can to deliver results for you.  So I know the hour is late. I know you have been incredibly patient. But I am so excited to be back here. I will be back. My team will be back. And we want you to be part of winning this election and moving our country into the future with optimism. Thank you. Hello, Pittsburgh! Wow! Thank you so much! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you very, very much. Wow! It is so great being back here in Pittsburgh with all of you, and I can't tell you how happy I am to be here with a Pittsburgh native who worked hard for everything that he has made and has helped a lot of people along the way. What he exemplifies is the American Dream, but he understands the dream gets bigger the more you share it. And I want to thank Mark Cuban for being here!  I loved hearing his stories. I especially loved everyone learning what he did when he became successful and sold companies. He shared. He shared the benefits with everybody who helped him be a success. He said, when he sold the company, the second one, for a big, big amount of money, he shared it with everybody, made 300 millionaires, including people who were working at minimum wage, because they helped him be a success. And Mark is right. I want to do what I can to make it possible for more people who help their businesses succeed share in the profits because when we share, we grow. And you know what I believe: We are stronger together, and that's how we're going to make it in America!  Now, I want to thank your elected officials who have been on this pre-program and thank them for their support because I am really looking forward to working with them. They're bringing people together on behalf of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County and Western Pennsylvania. So thanks to Congressman Mike Doyle. Thanks to Mayor Bill Peduto, thanks for Allegheny County Executor Rich Fitzgerald, Councilman Dan Gilman, and Mayor John Fetterman from Braddock PA.  Now, as you heard from Tim Kaine, we are on a bus tour and we are having a great time because you get to drive through Pennsylvania, which really is one of the most beautiful places on Earth and I don't say it because it's the first time I've seen it. My father was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania and every summer of our lives we drove from outside of Chicago where we lived to Scranton. And because we did it every year and a lot of times also during Christmas, we took different routes. So I was in Pittsburgh a lot. And my dad and my brother went to Penn State so I was in State College at lot.  So for me this is really a sentimental tour through Pennsylvania, and it gives me such personal joy because I love this commonwealth and I know that a lot of good things are happening here because people are working together. But we're going to make more good things happen. We're going to have a coordinated, specific set of plans to create more jobs right here in Pennsylvania, to give more people a chance to fulfill their own dreams, to lift up the incomes of hardworking people, to create what I view as an opportunity society, where if you do your part you can get ahead and stay ahead. That's the basic bargain of America and we're going to keep our end of it.  Now, as you heard Tim say, I have laid out plans in this campaign. I have this old-fashioned idea that basically I'm being interviewed to be hired. This is a giant job interview. And I'm hoping I am hired and the other guy is fired. But I'm not asking you I'm not asking you to vote for me just because I show up and just because I tell you you're supposed to believe in me and you're supposed to just count on me to come up with something that I don't tell you about beforehand. I'm not doing that. I'm laying out my plans in this campaign.  And here's what we're going to do. We're going to, in the first 100 days, break through the gridlock in Washington and have the biggest infrastructure and jobs program that we've had since World War II. We're going to be investing in our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. But we're also going to be investing in a new electric grid that can then take advantage and distribute all the new, clean, renewable energy we're going to be producing.  And we're going to do something else. We are going to finish the job of providing high-speed, affordable broadband internet connectivity to every single home and business in America. I was in Harrisburg last night and I told the crowd there beautiful night, place called the Broad Street Market. It was just magical. And I told them we were going to do this on broadband. And then I said I was talking to a bunch of teachers, and they just did a survey, a national survey I love teachers. I could tell you something about every one of my public school teachers starting in kindergarten all the way through 12th grade.  But I was talking to them and they said 70 percent of the teachers in America assign homework to our kids that requires the kids to go on the internet. Now, I think that makes sense. Just like Mark was a pioneer in using the internet to deliver services, we want our kids to know how to use it and how to learn from it. And who knows? They may grow up and follow in Mark's footsteps or whatever the next generation is.  But here's the kicker: 5 million kids in our country don't now have access to the internet in a way that enables them to do the homework they're asked to do. That's 5 million kids who are being left out. And after I finished saying that in Harrisburg I was walking the line, as I will after I talked here, meeting people, shaking hands, and one of the men I met said, "You know, that's only half of it. We still have places in Pennsylvania,' he told me, "where our only option is dial-up.' Right? I see heads nodding. How are we going to be a competitive 21st century economy and take on and win in the world if we can't even get broadband, if we can't even get internet connectivity to every single home and business? And we're going to do that.  Now, in addition to growing the economy we are going to make it fairer. And this is a big deal too, because I want everybody to be lifted up. I want everybody to benefit from their hard work the way Mark has done with his businesses. There's a couple of things we can do at the government level as well as encourage more businesses to follow Mark's example. We can raise the national minimum wage so that more people have a chance to get themselves out of poverty and into the middle class. And we can do more to help small businesses because that is where more of the new jobs are created, so let's do more to get them the credit they need and get rid of the red tape and the bureaucratic obstacles.  But you know the fastest way to raise incomes in America. It's pretty simple. Let's finally guarantee equal pay for women's work. Now, I've got to add, I think most of you know this, but this is not a woman's issue. It isn't. Because here's what I'd ask you: If you have a working mom, wife, sister, or daughter, it's your issue. It's a family issue. And when women are shortchanged, families are shortchanged and the economy is shortchanged.  And the other thing we're going to do, we're going to make sure that we pay for everything I'm proposing, everything from paid family leave to preschool for kids. We're going to make sure we pay for it. Because I want you to know exactly what I'm going to do and exactly how I'm going to pay for it, and I am going to go where the money is. You know that old movie Follow the Money? Well, 90 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent, so we're going to try to get those who've been successful sorry, Mark we're going to try to get those who have been successful to help us fund what will make America even more successful and create more millionaires and more billionaires, more entrepreneurs, more success stories. You see, I am so excited in part because I've seen what Pittsburgh has done. I told you I used to come to Pittsburgh all the time, so I have had a firsthand look at the way this great American city has reinvented itself. It didn't happen by people insulting each other. It didn't happen by folks pointing fingers and demeaning one another. It happened because people got together and said, "Wait a minute, we love this place.' Right?  So how do we reimagine and reinvent Pittsburgh for the future? Let's not just keep looking backwards. Let's look forwards. How do we create more jobs? How do we bring young people back? During the primary I was at Carnegie Mellon, and I was knocked over by what I saw going on there.  So I get excited. I want us to really believe that America's best years are ahead of us, but to understand the only way we're going to make that a reality is by working together and recognizing that we've got to do more to make sure everybody is brought alone. Education is still the door to opportunity, but it's not just one kind of education. You know I believe we need to start with preschool education, because I want every child prepared to be successful when that child gets to school.  And I want to be sure that in elementary and secondary school we're providing the tools that kids will need to make the most out of their own talents and ambition. And so let's make sure we've got computer science and coding and technology programs in our high schools again.  And I have a plan to make community college free so that more people can get two-year degrees to get a good job.  There are about a million jobs right now that aren't being filled, and a lot of those jobs are in the trades. A lot of those jobs require skills. We are going to have a shortage of machinists and welders and tool-and-die makers, and these are good jobs and I want us to start respecting the work that people do to build America again.  And then we're going to do more with apprenticeship programs. I'm going to offer a tax credit so that businesses will provide apprenticeship programs that will pay, that will pay young people to learn the skills that will give them a path to a new job. And I'm going to support unions that are already providing apprenticeship programs for young people.  And we are going to make public colleges and universities debt-free so that every single young person can afford to go. And then we are going to give you ways to refinance your student debt to get the cost down. It's just not right. Donald Trump gets to take bankruptcy. American families and students get stuck. Well, we're going to change that. We're going to give you a way to pay less because we're going to lower interest rates, pay it as a percentage of your income, put a date certain when your obligations end; and if you do public service like teaching or policing or firefighting, we're going to forgive your college debt.  Now, I'm excited by this because I have seen it work. I know that if we make up our minds and roll up our sleeves, we will create these jobs and we will unleash a whole new generation of entrepreneurs. I want young people to feel like they can start their own businesses, they can take chances. I really appreciated Mark saying, you know what, he didn't succeed 100 percent of the time, I don't know anybody who has. But you learn by trying, and I want to encourage more Americans not just to dream again but try again.  And I want people to know that we can make things in America, because I believe that if we put our minds to it, we can do more in advanced manufacturing, clean energy technology. We can bring back some precision machining from Germany and Japan with a public-private partnership where we work to support manufacturers so that they can be competitive worldwide.  Now, Donald Trump talks a big game about putting America first. But then you actually peel back the story and what do you find? He makes Trump shirts in Bangladesh, not Ashland, Pennsylvania. He makes Trump furniture in Turkey, not Freeburg, Pennsylvania. He makes Trump picture frames in India, not Bristol, Pennsylvania. And I just have to point out, my husband is wearing a shirt that was made right here in Pennsylvania, in Reading Reading, Pennsylvania. And when we were packing for the bus tour and he said, "Well, what am I supposed to wear,' I said, "Well, I don't know. It's sort of bus tour casual.' And so he's going through his closet, and this morning in the hotel in Harrisburg he's putting this shirt on. He goes, "You know what? This shirt was made in Reading, Pennsylvania, and you will not believe this, at a company called "Bill's.'  So we have a very stark choice in this election. It really is about the difference between pulling together, working together, making the future better together, and living with fear and anxiety and the kinds of insults, the bigotry, the blustering and bullying that we're seeing from the other side.  Now, I know because I've had the great experience of observing presidents up close and working for four years for President Obama as Secretary of State and even working with Republican presidents. I may not have agreed with what their positions were, but I will tell you this: I've had the great privilege of observing presidents, listening to them, understanding what they're trying to achieve. And even where our positions diverge, I have never doubted that they were trying to figure out, in their own minds based on their own experiences, what was right for America. We've never had someone run for president who is so manifestly temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.  And I understand what he's doing. There are a lot of people in our country who are frustrated. They feel like maybe the economy has passed them by, that their government doesn't help them, that nobody is listening to them, nobody cares about them. I get that. That's why I said in my convention speech I want to be a president for all Americans Republicans, independents Democrats, people who vote for me, people who don't vote for me.  Because I think we all are in this together, and I know that if we decide we're going to set some big goals for America, we'll achieve them because that's what we've always done. And so when I think about the next 100 days of this campaign here in Pennsylvania, I will be doing everything I can to reach out and meet as many people as possible. I will go everywhere that Tim and I and Bill and Ann can reach. I will make sure that you know what I stand for, what I want to do, because I want you to hold me accountable. I want you to say, "I came and heard her.'"  AUDIENCE: "Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!"  HILLARY CLINTON: "Because I need your ideas not just during the campaign but afterwards. I want us to begin a conversation that keeps going. As president I won't be stuck in the White House. I'm going to be traveling around America having meetings, listening, trying to learn what more we can do.  But I can't get there without your help. I am inviting you to join this campaign. Please, if you will, text JOIN, J-O-I-N, to 47246 or go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up, be part of this campaign. And by the way, we are hiring organizers in Allegheny County and across Pennsylvania right now.  I want to end where Mark took us, because as I was backstage listening to him I've watched him on Shark Tank. And I've watched him very respectfully try to figure out how can I help somebody. If I can't, I can't. But if I can, here's what I'd like to do. And I've really admired that, Mark. I really did. Because we've got to have that attitude in our country again. How are we going to help each other, lift each other up, have each other's back? This country is really a place that people dream and build together. With us in Philadelphia were so many wonderful people who told their stories. If you saw them during the convention, you heard the bravery, the determination.  That, to me, is the best of America. Whatever position one holds, whatever kind of background one has, getting up every day trying to make the most out of your own life, trying to get your family to go through barriers and obstacles to make the most out of theirs, reaching out to neighbors, being part of this dream that we all share the American dream is not limited, my friends. The American dream is as big as we make it. And with your help, we're going to make it bigger than ever. Let's go win in November. Thank you and God bless you. Thank you! Thank you all so much. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. I have to begin by thanking our hosts, the people of Philadelphia. You know a little something about history and about making history. And I am so grateful to everyone in this city who pulled such a great convention together, who were so gracious, welcoming and hospitable, and I am thrilled that so many Americans from everywhere got a chance to see Philadelphia! To see what's in this great city.  People kept coming back from going for walks, going to museums, going to other sites, telling me how much they were impressed. And so I want to thank your mayor. Thank you, Mayor Kenney. I want to thank your Congressman who tries to come home to Philadelphia everyday and I know why, because he loves this city: Bob Brady!  I am always happy to be here with someone who's been a friend for Bill and me over so many years, an extraordinary public servant and advocate, former governor and mayor, Ed Rendell.  Now I, like Tim, I had the great pleasure of serving in the senate with senator Bob Casey, and I appreciated his tenacity, the attention to detail, the work he did for you every single day. And so I want to thank Bob, and I want also to recognize who I hope will be his partner in the Senate come November, Katie McGinty.  And I hope the next Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro.  This has been such an invigorating, exciting week. As I said last night, we heard from the man from Hope, Bill Clinton. And we heard from the man of hope, Barack Obama.  And I was so excited to introduce to America our partners. It's going to be fun to travel with both Tim and Anne because they are going to demonstrate to the country what the people of Virginia already know. There are no better people to have in your corner than Tim Kaine and Anne Holton.  Now I don't know about you, but I stayed up really late last night. It was just hard to go to sleep. Oh, thank you, thank you. It was so exciting, but I have to tell you, it was also kind of overwhelming. I take deeply and with great humility the responsibility that this campaign imposes on us.  There is no doubt in my mind that every election in our democracy is important in its own way, but I can't think of an election that is more important, certainly in my lifetime. And it's not so much that I'm on the ticket, it is because of the stark choice that is posed to America in this election.  So when I did, when I did wake up this morning, thank you when I did start moving, and Bill and I started drinking our coffee, or asking that it be administered through an IV, we suddenly looked at each other and we realized, as of tomorrow, we have 100 days to make our case to America.  So what better place to kick off this campaign than right here in Philadelphia where it all started 240 years ago. I believe with all my heart that our Founders came together to create one nation because they understood what we understand: we are stronger together!  And as we pointed out during our four great days of our convention, you heard something very different from the Republicans, didn't you? We might as well be talking about two different countries, or, as someone said to me, two different planets.  Donald Trump painted a picture, a negative, dark, divisive picture of a country in decline. He insisted that America is weak, and he told us all, after laying out this very dark picture, that "I alone can fix it.'  Now, as I watched and heard that, it set off alarm bells because just think about what happened here 240 years ago. Think about our Founders, coming together, a Declaration of Independence, writing a Constitution. They set up our form of government, the longest lasting democracy in the history of the world. And you know they did it because they knew they didn't want one person, one man to have all the power like a king. And think about George Washington, our first president. After he served, he stepped down voluntarily. People around him couldn't believe it, but he said no, this is an example we should set.  A democracy requires something from all of us, not just people we elect, but every single one of us. And Washington set that example. And I don't know any Founder, no matter how strong they were, how smart they were who believed that only they could solve our problems, so ;and I'll tell you something else they also expected a kind of raucous debate in America. But at the end of the debate, we have to come together and get things done, don't we?  So as Tim said, we are going to get on a bus as soon as we leave here and we're going to drive through Pennsylvania into Ohio. It's kind for nostalgic for me, my dad was born in Scranton, I spent every summer of my life up in northeast Pennsylvania. My father, my brother went to Penn State, so I know, I know how beautiful this commonwealth is and how wonderful the people are.  But we've got work to do. I'm not satisfied with the status quo. I'm not telling you that everything is just peachy keen. I'm telling you, we've made progress but we have work to do if we're going to make sure that everybody is included.  And you know, I think that we've got to have more good jobs, we've got to raise wages, we've got to tackle inequality. We've got to make this economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.  And if you listen really closely to the Republican Convention, you know that Donald Trump talked for 75 minutes and did not offer one solution. In fact, his speech, his whole convention seemed more about insulting me instead of helping the American people.  So here's what I've said I will do. And we're going to get to work on the very first day, within the first 100 days of our administration we're going to break through the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We're going to do it in infrastructure, technology, clean energy, advanced manufacturing.  And I'm also going to pay special attention to those parts of our country that have been left out and left behind. From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction and places hollowed out by plant closures.  Anybody willing to work in America should be able to find a job to get ahead and stay ahead. That's my goal.  So on our bus tour we're going to be visiting a few places where people are making things. I find it highly amusing that Donald Trump talks about "Make America Great Again.' He doesn't make a thing in America except bankruptcies.  So there's a lot to be done my friends, and I'm excited. I'm excited to have Tim and Anne as part of this team, and I'm excited to have the 42nd President of the United States as part of this team. The four of us are going to barnstorm the country because, as a very smart president who just so happens to be here today once said, "There is nothing wrong with America that can't be cured by what's right with America.'  So now, we had a great convention, but we've got to go out and we've got to fight for our vision of the future. And I can't do it alone. I need each and every one of you, here's what I ask you to do. Please, join us. Go to hillaryclinton.com or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to be part of this campaign. And we are hiring organizers here in Pennsylvania and across the country.  And between now and election day, we are going to register 3 million more people. And we're not just going to register them, we're going to get them to commit to vote.  We feel deeply the responsibility for continuing the work that started down the road from here 240 years ago. Now, nobody who looks like me was thought to be possible to run for president back then. No one who looked like Barack Obama was thought to be possible.  But contrary to Donald Trump, I believe every time we knock down a barrier in America, it liberates everyone in America.  I have to say, last night, after the end of our convention, I knew that every parent in this country could look at their son or their daughter and now say the very same thing: you too could be President of the United States.  Thank you all, God bless you! Thank you, Tampa! Thank you all. Thank you so much. Whoa. Are we ready to go win an election in November? Well, I think after the last week, what we saw in Cleveland, we'd better be ready to go win an election in November.  I want to thank Delia for those wonderful words about her life growing up here in Tampa and her strong endorsement. I want to thank my longtime friend and my colleague from the Senate, your Senator Bill Nelson. I also want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Bob Buckhorn. I also have a few others to thank, because I'm thrilled to have so many strong Florida leaders here with us today County Commissioner Les Miller; former Governor and soon-to-be congressman Charlie Crist; former Mayor Sandy Freedman; and we've got a great group of state representatives, councilmembers, and so many more, and I am grateful to each and every one of you who are here with us.  I've got to tell you, did any of you watch that convention in Cleveland? (Boos.) Well, it was kind of perversely flattering. It's hard to believe they spent so much time talking about me and no time talking about jobs or education or health care. No matter what your political leanings, I think we can all agree that never in the history of conventions, certainly, but I think even more broadly, have we moved forward together by pointing fingers and scapegoating and blaming people instead of rolling up our sleeves, getting a plan together, and then working to achieve it.  Now, I mean, something has gone terribly wrong when one speaker says "vote your conscience' and gets booed. I mean, I never thought I would say these words, but Ted Cruz was right. In this election, do the right thing and vote your conscience vote for your future; vote for a United States of America.  Now, look, I think many of us felt that those speakers, including of course their nominee, were not talking about the country we know and love. They weren't talking about the work people do every day, the opportunities we try to seize, neighbors helping neighbors. I didn't hear any of that. Instead, I heard about Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision. Last night's speech took it to a whole new level. He offered a lot of fear and anger and resentment, but no solutions about anything that he even talked about.  He didn't have a jobs program, did he? All that talk about keeping people safe; I didn't hear any plans about what he's going to do to support our police, to make sure that we are all working together. You could listen to that speech and you could think, my goodness, he believes America is in decline. And I've got to say, as he said this last night, I was pretty shocked. He said, "I alone can fix it.' Now, just think about that for a minute, because it's really important. His vision of America is one where we Americans are kind of helpless, we need to be rescued. I can't really imagine him on a white horse, but that seems to be what he's telling us: "I alone can fix it.' Well, he doesn't understand that Americans, we Americans, we are strong, big-hearted, results-oriented, generous people in America.  I've spent a lot of time, a lot of wonderful times, traveling across our country, and I've seen people fixing all kinds of things. I've met educators like Delia, working with teachers and parents to turn around schools and give kids a better chance. I've met small businesses and entrepreneurs who get up every day and work really hard. And you know when they make a contract for their goods or their services, they expect to be paid. I've met so many wonderful men and women who serve in our military; they know their job, they know the grave responsibility that they fulfill, and they get up every day and they do their best. But I've never heard one of them say, "Oh, I can fix it alone.'  I was in Orlando before I came here to Tampa. And I had the great honor of sitting and talking with some of the residents of that beautiful city, and hearing what they are doing together to deal with the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in American history. The mayor spoke with great pride about how his city had responded. The police captain in charge of the SWAT team talked with such conviction about how when the moment arrived, the police in Orlando were ready. They had trained. They supported each other. They were ready. The captain didn't say, "I can fix it alone.' He said, "I'm a member of a team the best team that anybody could have.'  I met some of the hospital and the medical personnel who were there to take the wounded and worked so heroically to save lives, every one of them doing his or her part triage, nursing doing everything. I didn't meet any one of them who said, "Hey, I can fix it alone.'  I've never heard of an American leader, or at least someone who wants to be an American leader, claiming that he's all we need. That's not a democracy, my friends. As I recall, we had a revolution to make sure we didn't have someone who said, "I can fix it alone.'  The other thing he said that really shocked me it is hard to know where to start, isn't it? Well, last night Donald told us, "I am your voice.' Well, I don't think he speaks for most Americans, do you? He doesn't speak for small businesses like the ones he has consistently stiffed and driven into bankruptcy and financial peril. He doesn't speak for the workmen that he's employed on his various projects and then refused to pay them. He doesn't speak for the housekeepers and the cooks and everybody working at a hotel in Las Vegas that he owns that have voted to have a union and he refuses to even talk to them. He doesn't speak for immigrants; he only speaks against immigrants. He doesn't speak for people with disabilities. He doesn't speak for our military, which he has insulted consistently, and in particular, prisoners of war who sacrifice much of their life because they serve us. And contrary to what they tried to say at their convention, I don't think he speaks for women. I don't think he speaks for working families who would be devastated by his reckless economic policies. He doesn't speak for anyone who thinks our country should be standing together not splintering apart. He sure doesn't speak for me, because I know we are stronger together and that's what we're going to be next year.  Now, starting on Monday in Philadelphia, we will offer a very different vision. It's about building bridges, not walls, between people. It's about making the economy work for everyone not just those at the top. It's about embracing our diversity that does make our country great.  I have to tell you, in Orlando today, in listening to people who had been there that night, meeting a mother whose son died, meeting others who barely escaped after hiding from the killer, sitting around a table with leaders of the LGBT community, leader of the SWAT team, a county commissioner, and a Muslim imam who has been embracing the LGBT community, I was so proud, I was so proud. But well, I'm proud of everybody in this country who gets up every day and makes a contribution and does your part. And what the folks in Orlando said to me was so touching. They said, "We have to stand against hatred no matter who it's against' racial hatred, religious hatred, homophobia, xenophobia all of these hates that infect the soul. And we have to stand against violence everywhere, and that includes standing up for common sense gun safety measures.  I want to say something else, I really do, because this is serious to me. I love this country. I am so grateful for all the opportunities and blessings I've had, and I am so humbled by the prospect of being nominated next week in Philadelphia. But here's what I want you to hear: I will do everything I can to make life better for hardworking Americans. I will do everything I can to bring people together. I will do everything I can to keep us safe, and I know a little bit about that.  Now, you can't put this you can't really put this into law is what I'm about to say, but we need more love and kindness in this country. We need more respect between and among our fellow Americans. We need to be listening more to each other. The last thing we need are leaders who try to divide us even more than we are. We should be working to reach out to those who are different from us. Our differences, which make up our diversity, makes the United States the strongest, best positioned country in the world for the 21st century.  I am proud to be an American, and I want to be sure that our children and our grandchildren have the same pride and the same opportunity to have the access to the American dream that so many of us have had so that they too can enjoy the fruits of freedom and liberty, justice and equality and opportunity.  Now, look, I understand that there is a constituency for the fear and the anger that we saw last week. I know there are people who are feeling insecure and anxious about their lives, about their futures. They worry that maybe they're not going to have as a high a standard of living as their parents or grandparents or as they themselves hoped. I know that there's a lot of angst about all the changes that are happening in the world technology, globalization. I understand all that. And I respect those who have legitimate concerns and questions.  But I've never known America to quit on ourselves. I've never known us to give up in the face of tough challenges. I've never known us to basically retreat into the kind of isolationism that was being advertised at their convention. That is not who we are. Those are not the values that made this a great country. And don't ever forget: We are a great country already!  Now, can we do better? Of course we can. Can we be fairer? Can we provide more ladders of opportunity? Yes, we can. And that's exactly what I intend to do if I'm given the great privilege of being your president. I will work every single day to make your dreams come true, to make you believe that America's future can be even better than our past. We are a forward-looking nation, aren't we? And I know that if we set our goals and we work to achieve them, we will. It has always been thus. This country has always delivered for the American people.  Now, we've had some challenging times. We've taken some detours. It took a long time for some people to be given the same rights as everybody else. We know that. But there is no place on Earth that historically has continued to move forward towards that more perfect union. The last thing we need is somebody running for president who talks trash about America.  So I hope you know that this campaign is really going to take a lot of work. I hope you will join us. I hope you will take your phones out and text, "join,' J-O-I-N, 47246, or go to my website, hillaryclinton.com, to get involved. And I want to tell you this, especially the young and young at heart. We are hiring organizers right here in Florida. If you would like to apply, go to that website. We want the very most energetic, enthusiastic people because our success in the I-4 corridor is essential to our winning.  And I'm excited about this campaign because I believe that when it's all said and done, all of the scary speeches with all the side effects are over, people have stopped yelling at us at the top of their lungs like they did all week, that we will choose to be stronger together. That's what I'm counting on. That's what I, in my heart, believe, is the right course for our country. It is the only course, the only course that leads us with confidence and optimism into the future. And I know that we are up to the task. I know we are. And particularly to all the young people who are here today, every election is always about the future. This election is truly about your future.  So today in Orlando, when I asked everybody around the table what they wanted, what they needed, they basically said, "We need people to understand what we've gone through, to be there for us for the long term, to help us help all those who were affected in all the families, and we need to stand up against hate and divisiveness.' And the best way I can sum up what I hope this election will lead to the conclusion we will reach together in November and the work we will do for the next four years-- is it really is great to be among so many optimistic people but here's what I here is what I want you to remember. My last thought for you today. Just remember, love trumps hate. Thank you all very, very much, please be seated, it's wonderful being back here. It's always a special privilege having grown up in Chicago in the suburbs to be here in the state capitol and especially here in this great historic place filled with so much meaning, not just for Illinois but for our country. And I'm delighted to have this opportunity to talk with you about the state of our country today.  Nearly 160 years ago, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech in this statehouse that marked a turning point in the political life of our nation.  The question of slavery was being fiercely debated across America. Roughly half the states allowed it. Half abolished it. And some people -- including Lincoln -- believed that until it was gone entirely, our country would never be truly united and at peace.  So on June 16, 1858, when Mr. Lincoln kicked off his campaign for the United States Senate, he delivered an address on how slavery was tearing our country apart. And that it must go. Some thought that he ended up losing that Senate race because of that speech. But then he won the Presidency. And some thought it was because of that speech.  President Lincoln led America during the most challenging period in our nation's history. He defended our Union, our Constitution, and the ideal of a nation "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.' His legacy included laws and amendments that enshrined those values for future generations. They protect and guide us still.  I'm here today, in this place, because the words Lincoln spoke all those years ago still hold resonance for us now.  Remember, he said, "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect,' he went on, "The Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall. But I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.' The challenges we face today do not approach those of Lincoln's time. Not even close. And we should be very clear about that.  But recent events have left people across America asking hard questions about whether we are still a house divided.  Despite our best efforts and highest hopes, America's long struggle with race is far from finished. In just the past week, we saw black men killed by police and five police officers killed by a sniper targeting white police. There is too much violence and hate in our country. Too little trust and common ground. It can feel impossible to have the conversations we need to have, to fix what's broken.  And despite being the richest country on earth, we have too much economic inequality -- and that also undermines the foundation of our democracy.  Lincoln understood that threat, too. He deeply believed everyone deserved -- in his words -- "a fair chance in the race of life.' He saw it as a defining feature of the United States, and believed it was vital that hard-working people be free to enjoy the fruits of their own labor. It's one of the reasons he was so strongly against slavery -- because it violated that entire notion. And as President, he took pains to use the tools of government to create more economic opportunity for Americans at every level of society. So, too, must we fight inequality and create opportunity in our time -- not just for some Americans, but for all.  So I come today as a mother and a grandmother to two beautiful little children. Who, I want them and all our children to grow up in a country where violence like the kind we saw last week doesn't happen again -- and where the American Dream is big enough for everyone.  I'm also here as a candidate for President who is deeply concerned about the divisions that still hold our people apart and our nation back. I believe that our future peace and prosperity depends on whether we meet this moment with honesty and courage.  That means taking a hard look at our laws and our attitudes. It means embracing policies that promote justice for all people, and standing firm against any attempt to roll back the clock on the rights and opportunities that so many sacrificed so much to secure.  And all of that starts with doing a better job of listening to each other. We need to listen to the families whose loved ones have been killed in police incidents. Alton Sterling and Philando Castile are just the latest in a long and painful litany of African Americans dying after encounters with police officers. We remember Laquan McDonald, killed in Chicago a year and a half ago and Sandra Bland, who grew up in Illinois who died one year ago today. Time after time, no one is held accountable. And surely we can all agree that's deeply wrong and needs to change.  And yes we do need to listen to those who say "Black Lives Matter.' Too many black Americans, especially young men, feel like their lives are disposable. And they worry every single day about what might happen. They have reason to feel that way. And it's absolutely unacceptable. Everyone in America, everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Surely that is something we can all unite behind.  We need to acknowledge the five Latinos who also lost their lives in police incidents last week. Their stories didn't get national media coverage, but their families and communities are mourning too.  And at the same time, we need to listen to the dedicated, principled police officers working hard every day to rebuild trust with the communities they serve and protect. Our men and women in blue put their lives on the line everyday to keep us safe and keep our democracy strong. Remember what Michael Krol, Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa were doing when they died. They were protecting a peaceful march. They were people cloaked in authority making sure their fellow citizens could exercise their right to protest authority. And there's nothing more vital to our democracy than that. And they gave their lives for it.  David Brown, the Dallas police chief, said that when it comes to overcoming systemic racism and so many other problems in society, we ask too much of the police and too little of everyone else. I think he's absolutely right. This is our problem, and we all need to work together to solve it.  We also need to listen to the families crying out for relief from gun violence. President Obama's trip to Dallas yesterday was the 11th time he has spoken to a city in mourning after a mass shooting. The wrong people keep getting their hands on guns. And not just any guns -- military weapons, like the kind that the Dallas killer had, which allowed him to outgun the police. And the vast majority of gun owners agree: we have to come together around common sense steps to prevent gun violence. If we're looking for common ground -- this is common ground. And I hope that we will, from Washington, to Springfield to everywhere across America, come to agreement about that.  Now I understand that just saying these things together may upset some people. I'm talking about police reform just a few days after a horrific attack on police officers. I'm talking about courageous, honorable police officers just a few days after officer-involved shootings in Louisiana and Minnesota. I'm bringing up guns in a country where just talking about comprehensive background checks and getting assault weapons off our streets gets you demonized.  But all these things can be true at the same time.  We do need criminal justice reform to save lives and to make sure all Americans are treated as equals in rights and dignity. We do need to support our police departments that are trying to get it right, and honor the men and women who protect us every day. We do need to do more to stop gun violence. We may disagree about how to do these things, but surely we can all agree with those basic premises.  And I hope and pray the past week has showed us how true they are.  Now, these are the issues on many of our minds right now. And if we stop there, that would leave us with plenty of work to do.  So I wish I could say that was everything that we must address.  But these events are taking place against a much broader backdrop of fear and anxiety. So I think we have to face all of it.  We do need to make sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. The changes that have roiled our economy over the past few decades are not just numbers on a page that economists study. They are real forces that families are dealing with up close and personal every day.  Not long ago, I met with factory workers here in Illinois whose jobs are being sent abroad, and heard how painful the consequences have been for them and their families. I've talked to workers across our country who've seen good jobs lost to technologies, who keep being told to get more training -- even though that often doesn't lead to a good new job on the other end.  These economic disruptions have stripped too many people of their sense of security and dignity. And that can have devastating consequences. We have to ask ourselves, why are drug addiction and suicide on the rise in parts of our country? That's not just about economics. It's about something deeper, that is connected to economics: a sense of dislocation, even a pessimism about whether America still holds anything for them or cares about them at all.  That's why I've pledged that in my first 100 days as President, we will make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. We need more jobs you can support a family on, especially in places that have been left out and left behind from Coal Country to Indian Country to inner cities, to every place that's been hollowed out when a factory closed or a mine shut down because everyone in America deserves that "fair chance in the race of life' that President Lincoln described.  Now, I realize that our politics have contributed to the sense of division many Americans feel right now. And as someone in the middle of a hotly fought political campaign, I cannot stand here and claim that my words and actions haven't sometimes fueled the partisanship that often stands in the way of progress. So I recognize I have to do better too.  I'm running for President with the belief that we need to face up to these challenges and fix them in order to become a stronger, fairer country. And in times like these, we need a President who can help pull us together, not split us apart.  And that is why I believe Donald Trump is so dangerous.  His campaign is as divisive as any we have seen in our lifetimes. It is built on stoking mistrust and pitting American against American. It's there in everything he says and everything he promises to do as President.  It's there in how he wants to ban Muslims from coming to the United States, and toyed with creating a database to track Muslims in America. It's there in the way he demeans women, in his promotion of an anti-Semitic image pushed by neo-Nazis, and in the months that he spent trying to discredit the citizenship and legitimacy of our first black President. Last night in an interview, he said that he understands systemic bias against black people because -- and I quote -- "even against me, the system is rigged' -- unquote. He went on to say, "I can relate to it very much myself.' Even this -- the killing of people -- is somehow all about him.  It's there in his proposals on immigration. He says he'll round up 11 million people and kick them out. He's actually described a special deportation force that would go around America, pulling people out of their homes and workplaces, pulling children out of school. I got a letter from a mother the other day who said her adopted son asked her with a shaky voice if President Trump would send him back to Ethiopia. When kids are scared by political candidates and policy debates, it's a sign something has gone badly wrong.  And we see it in the violence that Donald Trump encouraged toward protesters at his rallies, and the strange things he has said about the violence that will occur if we don't elect him. He says that if he doesn't win this November, we -- and again I quote -- "won't even have a country anymore,' America's "not going to continue to survive.' I do not know what he's talking about. But I do know we don't need that kind of fear-mongering -- not now, not ever.  And he's gone even further even than that. He has taken aim at some of our most cherished democratic values and institutions. He wants to revoke the citizenship of 4 million Americans born in this country to immigrant parents, and eliminate the bedrock principle enshrined in the 14th Amendment -- that if you're born in America, you're a citizen of America. He said that a distinguished American, born in Indiana, a judge can't be trusted to do his job because his parents were Mexican; he called him a "Mexican judge' over and over again. He knew that the judge had been born in Indiana. But it was a cynical, calculated attempt to fan the flames of racial division. And designed to undermine people's faith in our judicial system. Why would someone running for President want to do that?  And even that's not all. He says, as Commander-in-Chief, he would order our troops to commit war crimes, and insisted they would follow his orders, even though that goes against decades of military training and the military code. He's banished members of the press who have criticized him -- is there any doubt he would do the same as President? Imagine if he had not just Twitter and cable news to go after his critics and opponents, but also the IRS -- or for that matter, our entire military. Given what we have seen and heard, do any of us think he'd be restrained?  And he has shown contempt for and ignorance of our Constitution. Last week, he met with House Republicans in Washington to try to assuage their serious concerns about him. One member asked whether he'd protect Article I, which defines the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. Here's the answer he reportedly gave: "I want to protect Article One, Article Two, Article Twelve.' Well here's the thing -- there is no Article Twelve -- not even close. That was a serious question, from an elected representative, and he either didn't care enough to answer it seriously -- or he didn't know where to begin.  Even the most stalwart Republicans were alarmed by that. And well they, and we, should be.  The first thing a new President does is take an oath to "protect and defend' the Constitution. To do that with any meaning, you've got to know what's in it. And you've got to respect what's in it.  I do wish Donald Trump would listen to other people once in awhile. He might actually learn something. But he's made it clear -- that's not his thing. As he has said, he only listens to himself.  This man is the nominee of the Party of Lincoln. We are watching it become the Party of Trump. And that's not just a huge loss for our democracy -- it is a threat to it.  Because Donald Trump's campaign adds up to an ugly, dangerous message to America. A message that you should be afraid -- afraid of people whose ethnicity is different, or religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country or hold different political beliefs.  Make no mistake -- there are things to fear in this world, and we need to be clear-eyed about them. But we are each other's countrymen and women. We share this miraculous country. This land and its heritage is yours, mine and everyone's -- willing to pledge allegiance and understand the solemn responsibilities of American citizenship. That's what "indivisible' means -- that big word that every grade school student knows -- that we're in this together, even if that's not always easy.  So let's think better of each other. Let's hold together in the face of our challenges -- not turn on each other or tear each other down.  Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to a dangerous job we need them to do.  Let's put ourselves in the shoes of African Americans and Latinos, and try as best we can to imagine what it would be like if we had to have "the talk' with our kids about how carefully they need to act because the slightest wrong move could get them hurt or killed.  And yes, let's put ourselves in the shoes of Donald Trump's supporters. We may disagree on the causes and the solutions to the challenges we face -- but I believe like anyone else, they're trying to figure out their place in a fast-changing America.  They want to know how to make a good living and how to give their kids better futures and opportunities. That's why we've got to reclaim the promise of America for all our people -- no matter who they vote for. And let's be more than allies to each other. Let's take on each other's struggles as our own.  My life's work is built on the conviction that we are stronger together. Not separated into factions or sides. Not shouting over each other, but together. Our economy is stronger when everyone contributes to it, and everyone can benefit from the work they do. Our communities are stronger when we all pull together to solve our problems and restore our faith in each other, and by doing so in the promise of America. Our country is stronger when we work with our friends and allies to promote peace, prosperity, and security around the world.  This is an idea that goes back to the founding of America, when 13 separate colonies found a way -- despite their differences -- to join together as one nation. They knew they were not stronger on their own, and neither are we.  I've had the great delight of seeing the musical "Hamilton." And I hope more people at least get a chance to listen to the score and to hear the words. There's a great song by the character playing George Washington who sings, "History's eyes are on us.' That was true then, and that's true today.  If we do this right, and if we have the hard conversations we need to have, we will become stronger still -- like steel tempered by fire. Now don't get me wrong, fierce debates are part of who we are -- they started at my dinner table with my father, and have continued ever since. It is who we are. You're reminded of that when you read history, when you think about the Lincoln-Douglas Debates. Debate over the right way forward.  And sometimes we have to balance competing values like freedom and order, justice and security, these are complementary values of American life. That isn't easy. Previous generations have had to overcome terrible challenges. And no one more so than Abraham Lincoln. But in the end, if we do the work, we will cease to be divided. We, in fact, will be indivisible with liberty and justice for all. And we will remain -- in Lincoln's words -- the last, best hope of earth.  Thank you all very much. Thank you, It's great to be back in Raleigh! Thank you so much. I have to confess I was having such a good time backstage listening to the 120 Minutes Band, listening to Mary Wingate do the national anthem and just being absolutely transported by Shay Taylor and Friends, the gospel group that got us all going today. And I cannot thank a better twosome than the people you just saw up here.  Because I honestly believe Jim Hunt is not only one of the best governors North Carolina has ever had, but one of the best governors ever in America in the last years. And what he did to really put North Carolina on a path to the future has stood the test of time. We've had a few glitches with others who don't seem to understand what the ingredients are for building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. But Jim Hunt knows that.  I look forward to continuing to work with him. And I was so delighted to have a chance, as I did, to have Alicia Wilkerson talk about her journey, how hard she has worked, raising her children, getting an education, making it possible for her to have a better future.  I so greatly appreciate her mentioning the SCHIP program which has helped 8 million kids every year get health insurance. Now because we are in North Carolina and we have a lot of friends here I want to acknowledge some of them. Your Secretary of State Elaine Marshall.  Senator Dan Blue, the Minority Leader of the North Carolina Senate. Representative Larry Hall, the Democratic leader of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Linda Coleman running for Lieutenant Governor. Judge Mike Morgan running against a Republican Supreme Court incumbent. And don't forget than Dan Blue III is running for State Treasurer. Josh Stein, running for Attorney General. And let's give a big round of applause to your next governor, Attorney General Roy Cooper! Your next AG commissioner Walter Smith and your next United States Senator, Debra Ross. We're going to work hard in the this election to elect as many Democrats up and down the ticket so that North Carolina can get back on the path to the path to the future, get off this detour that you've been on.  I have to start by saying if you notice anything different about me today, it could be that now I have double the "grandmother glow." This past weekend, Chelsea and Marc had a little boy and we're all totally over the moon about it.  Obviously, our family will do everything we can to make sure little Charlotte and now little Aidan grow up with every possible opportunity. I know that's what every parent and grandparent, aunt or uncle, godmother and godfather, people who care about the children in our lives, that's exactly how we all feel.  I believe with all my heart that you should not have to be the grandchild of a former president or secretary of state to have every opportunity available to you in this country.  Every single child deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential and that has been the cause of my life.  It's rooted in the values I learned from my family and my faith. We're all in this together. And we have a responsibility to lift each other up.  As we Methodists say: Do all the good you can to all the people you can in all the ways you can. And that is absolutely true for our children.  That's why I got into public service in the first place. And it's why I'm determined that we will win this election.  I think it's an understatement to say that Americans face a choice in November.  As I said yesterday in Ohio, Donald Trump offers no real solutions for the economic challenges we face--he just continues to spout reckless ideas that will run up our debt and cause another economic crash.  I'm here today to offer an alternative. I have a clear vision for the economy, and it's this: We need to make sure our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.  Not just for the rich or the well-connected, not just for people living in some parts of the country, or people from certain backgrounds and not others--I mean everyone.  I have a plan to get us there: Five steps we can take together to drive growth that's strong, fair, and lasting. Growth that reduces inequality, increases upward mobility; that reaches into every corner of our country.  The measure of our success will be how much incomes rise for hardworking families. How many children are lifted out of poverty. How many Americans can find good jobs that support a middle class life and not only that, jobs that provide a sense of dignity and pride. That's what it means to have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That's the mission, and I'm asking all of you to join me in it.  We have to overcome some big challenges. I will admit that.  First, too many of our representatives in Washington are in the grips of a failed economic theory called trickle-down economics. I do not question their sincerity, but it has been proven wrong again and again.  But there are still people in Congress who insist on cutting taxes for the wealthy instead of investing in our future.  They careen from one self-inflicted crisis to another--shutting down the government, threatening to default on our national debt, refusing to make the commonsense investments that used to have broad bipartisan support, like rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our tunnels, our highways and airports, or investing in better education from zero through high school and college.  I like to look at evidence: I plead to that. I think evidence is important when making decisions that affect other people's lives. If the evidence were there to support this ideology, I would have to acknowledge that, but we have seen the results. Twice now in the past 30 years a Republican president has caused an economic mess and a Democratic president has had to come in and clean it up.  And yes, too many special interests and too many lobbyists have stood in the way of progress while protecting the perks of the privileged few.  It's not just Washington.  Too many corporations have embraced policies that favor hedge funds and other big shareholders and top management at the expense of their workers, communities, and even their long-term value.  They're driven by Wall Street's obsession with short-term share prices and quarterly earnings.  A recent survey of corporate executives found that more than half when asked would hold off on making a successful long-term investment--maybe in their workers, or plant equipment, or research--if it meant missing a target in the next earnings report.  So corporations stash cash overseas or they send it to top shareholders in the form of stock buybacks or dividends, instead of raising wages or investing in research and development.  This pressure, this short-term pressure, leads to perverse incentives and outrageous behavior.  It is wrong to take taxpayer dollars with one hand and give out pink slips with the other hand. And no company should be moving their headquarters overseas, just to avoid paying their taxes here at home.  In addition, there have been big changes in how American families live, learn, and work, but our policies haven't kept up.  There are so many examples of this.  Over the past several decades, women have entered the workforce and boosted our economy, yet we are the only, the only developed country that doesn't provide paid family leave of any kind.  We're asking families to rely on an old system of supports in a new economic reality. No wonder so many are struggling.  The bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation.  They let Wall Street take big risks with unregulated financial activities, they skew our tax code toward the wealthy, they failed to enforce our trade rules, they undermined workers' rights.  They have forgotten that we are all in this together and we are at our best when we recognize that. Excessive inequality such as we have today reduces economic growth. Markets work best when all the stakeholders share in the benefits.  The challenges we face are significant.  It is not easy to change Washington, or how corporations behave. It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan--it takes a plan.  It takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results.  That means we need a president who knows what we're up against, has no illusions about what we need to do to move ahead, but can actually get it done. And that is what I am offering.  Because there is good news. The good news is that everywhere I go, smart, determined men and women are working hard to reverse these trends.  Mayors are pioneering innovative ways to work with the private sector to invest in their cities.  Entrepreneurs and small businesses are building and hiring in places that bigger companies have abandoned.  Unions are providing training programs that add value to the companies that employ their members.  Union pension funds are already investing in infrastructure projects that have supported more than 100,000 jobs here in our country.  So do not grow weary, there are great ideas out there. And we are going to be partners in a big, bold effort to increase economic growth and distribute it more fairly.  To build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. I believe the federal government should adopt five ambitious goals:  First, let's break through the dysfunction in Washington to make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.  Second, let's make college debt-free for all. And transform the way we prepare Americans for the jobs of the future.  Third, let's rewrite the rules so more companies share profits with their employees, and fewer ship profits and jobs overseas.  Finally, let's make sure that Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes. And all of this depends upon putting our families first and matching our policies to how you actually live and work in the 21st century.  Briefly about these four points: Let's start with jobs.  Every American willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays enough to support a family. And I know we can do this because I've seen it in the past.  You know, I remember when I was growing up and America had come out from the upheaval of depression and world war. Our leaders worked together to invest in a new foundation for American power and prosperity.  Highways to connect up our entire nation. College and housing for returning veterans and their families. Unprecedented scientific research. And it worked--we built the greatest middle class the world has ever known.  Now, we have to get as ambitious again. There is nothing we can't do. Let's be just as ambitious to build our 21st century American economy to produce the same results for hard working Americans.  In my first 100 days as president, I will work with both parties to pass a comprehensive plan to create the next generation of good jobs. Now the heart of my plan will be the biggest investment in American infrastructure in decades, including establishing an infrastructure bank that will bring private sector dollars off the sidelines and put them to work here.  And I've talked with local leaders around America and I've seen the dire need for investment. In Tampa, for example, I saw how a smart, targeted highway investment near a major port can create thousands of good-paying jobs, support the local economy and unlock national commerce.  We can create millions of good-paying jobs while preparing America to compete and win in the global economy.  So let's set these big national goals. And I know how important it is to rebuild our roads, our bridges and our airports, but we have more work to do. Let's build better. And let's connect every household to broadband by the year 2020.  Let's build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country. Let's fix failing water systems like the one that poisoned children in Flint, Michigan. Let's renovate our public schools so every child in every community has access to safe, high-tech classrooms, laboratories, and libraries.  Our 100 Days jobs package will also include transformational investments in key drivers of growth:  Advance manufacturing, so we can "make it in America" and compete and win in the global economy.  Making America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, which will create millions of jobs and help protect our planet.  Recommitting to scientific research, which can create new whole industries, just like we did in the '90s, when we started mapping the human genome.  And small businesses, which should be the engine for creating new jobs across America, they need to be free of red tape and they need to have access to credit. We need to slash unnecessary regulations making it easier to get startup capital from community banks and credit unions. If you have an idea for a small business, we want you to get started.  Let's free entrepreneurs to do what they do best--innovate and grow and hire and make sure that the new service and caregiving jobs being created today are jobs that pay well, too. And that does mean raising the national minimum wage.  So many of these are so personal to us that they need to be respected and lifted up. And I know too that we've got work to do to stand with those who are fighting for raising the minimum wage. It's not always how we think about this, but I can tell you another engine for growth and job creation would be comprehensive immigration reform.  It will bring millions of workers into the formal economy so you don't have an unlevel playing field, so that workers who are competing for those jobs don't get undercut because employers go out and find undocumented workers to do those jobs for a lower wage. I really believe it's not just the right thing to do, but it will be great.  It will be smart for our economy. I want people to be able to compete. I don't want to have that disadvantage that exists in too many places, where people are being are being priced out of the jobs they've always done.  So we can work toward a full employment and full potential economy. That does mean we can't ignore people that are still stuck on the sidelines, or working part-time when what they really want is a full-time job. Or those trapped in long-term joblessness, whether they're veterans, workers with disabilities, people coming home from prison, or young people who tried to start their careers in the midst of the Great Recession. I particularly want young people to feel that they are going to get good jobs that will give them that ladder of opportunity that they deserve to have in America.  That's why I want to expand incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit, Empowerment Zones, and other ideas that bring business, government, and communities together to create good jobs in poor or remote areas. Places that have lost a factory or a mine where generations of families used to work. Anyone willing to work should get the help they need to qualify for and find that good job.  That means breaking down the barriers of systemic racism and discrimination that hold back --those barriers, they hold back African Americans, Latinos, Asian and Native Americans, and women from fully participating in our economy.  We need to reverse the long-term neglect that has dried up jobs and opportunity in communities of color, in poor communities. It's not by accident that the unemployment rate now among black Americans is twice as high as among whites. Back in the '90s, we were closing that gap, incomes were going up for everybody.  I think we're going to have to invest money to create jobs for young people because right now I'm worried that if young people don't get that first job when they are young, learn about work, understand the obligations as well as the promise of work, it will be even more difficult to get them into the workforce later on.  It is way past time for us to guarantee equal pay for women, which is still not the reality.  So, you see it is not enough to have an affirmative agenda, we have to knock down those barriers.  And by the way, as you've seen here in North Carolina discriminating against LGBT Americans is bad for business.  And make no mistake, we will defend American jobs and American workers by saying "no" to bad trade deals and unfair trade practices, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which does not meet my high bar for creating good-paying jobs. "No" to assaults on the right to organize and bargain collectively.  "No" to every attack on the dignity of working families.  We're going to make this economy work for everyone, and it's time we start building this from the ground up. For every home and every community all the way to Washington. Now, I know very well that if you don't have the skills for the jobs of tomorrow, it's going to be difficult. Education is still the pathway for greater opportunities for many Americans.  Let's start at the beginning with making quality, affordable child care and preschool available in every community in the next 10 years, so we get our littlest Americans off to the best start.  Jim Hunt was a pioneer in this. Why did he care so much about children zero to five, besides the fact that he cared about them? Because he knew there was a direct line to how the youngest children were treated, educated, and prepared for school, and what kind of jobs and economic competitiveness North Carolina would have. So we're going to start by having families be their child's first teachers, and we're going to give them the support they need to do that. And when it comes to primary and secondary education I pledged to you we're going to make sure all our kids have good teachers and good schools, no matter what ZIP code you live in.  You know, for many years, thanks to people and leaders like Jim Hunt, North Carolina was a leading state when it came to education. Now, unfortunately, thanks to your Governor McCrory and the legislature, the average teacher salary can barely support a family. It should not be a surprise that thousands have quit in recent years.  We should support our teachers, not scapegoat them.  And then let's make sure every student has options after high school. Whether it's a four-year degree, free community college, an apprenticeship, or other forms of higher education, we need to provide the skills and credentials that match the job openings of today and tomorrow.  That's why I'm proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to offer paid apprenticeships that lets you earn while you learn. And I will to support the union apprenticeships and training programs already out there. Not every good job requires a four-year college degree. We need to dignify skills training. So many young people have the talent and the will to succeed--they just need a helping hand.  That's why I want us to come together to help our young people break free from the burden of student debt. I'm sure we all have stories. I've met so many who told me they can't start a business. They can't even move out of their parent's basement because of all the student debt holding them back.  Let's set the goal to make debt-free college available to everyone. So future students won't have to borrow a dime to pay for tuition at public college or university.  And let's liberate the millions of Americans who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance, just like a mortgage. Let's make it easier to have debt forgiven by doing national service, let's make it easier to repay what you owe as a portion of your income so you never have to pay more than you can afford.  I've set out a way to do this, and we'll be talking more about it as we go forward in this campaign.  My third goal is to rewrite the rules so more companies share profits with employees, and fewer ship profits and jobs overseas.  I know there are a lot of businesses thriving here in North Carolina and across our country who see employees as assets to invest in, not costs to cut. They're building companies, not stripping them. They're creating good jobs, not eliminating them.  But too many, too many businesses take the opposite view. I'm not asking corporations to be more charitable, although I think that is important. I'm asking corporations to realize that when more Americans prosper, they prosper too, right? When your paycheck grows, America grows.  We are a 70 percent consumption economy. If we want higher growth, we have to raise incomes. So people have more disposable dollars to be able to spend, instead of holding back out of fear of what will happen.  So let's bring a long-term view back to board rooms and executive suites. Let's restore the link between productivity growth and wage growth.  As president, I will make it a national priority for more companies to share profits with employees. On top of, not instead of, good wages. Let's recognize the people doing the work, putting in the hours, they're the ones who should be sharing the rewards.  We should continue to crack down on wage theft and make overtime count, so companies that pay well can't be undercut by competitors paying poverty wages.  I believe we should strengthen unions, which have formed the bedrock of a strong middle class. It should be easier to bargain collectively. That's not only fair, it makes workers more productive, it strengthens our economy.  And let's close the loopholes that help companies ship jobs and profits overseas. Let's make companies that outsource jobs to other countries pay back the tax breaks they received while they were here in America. And if corporations try to move their headquarters to a foreign country to skip out on their tax bills--let's slap a new exit tax on them and then put that money to work in the communities left behind.  And we should extend the rules that were passed in Dodd-Frank on Wall Street after the crisis and strengthen them--both for the big banks and the shadow banking system. And I will veto any reforms to repeal those rules and vigorously enforce the law, with accountability, so Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.  Fourth, let's make sure Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich pay their fair share of taxes.  When people say the game is rigged, the best evidence is the tax code. It's riddled with scams, loopholes, and special breaks, like the carried-interest loophole that lets some hedge fund managers pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. That's not only unfair, it's bad economics, and we're going to stop it.  I have been saying that for years. As president, if Congress won't act, I will ask the Treasury Department to use its authority to close that loophole.  And here's another idea that I will be pushing: Let's pass the so-called Buffett Rule so top executives can't pay a lower rate than their secretaries.  And let's ask the wealthiest Americans to pay more--including a new tax on multimillionaires. That's not only the right thing to do, it's smart for our economy.  Because these steps will help pay for the investments we need in jobs and education without increasing our national debt. In fact, every program I have proposed in this campaign, I tell you how I will pay for it. Donald Trump and I disagree on a lot of things, and one of them is simple math.  Finally, here's our fifth goal: Let's put families first and make sure our policies match how you actually work and live in the 21st century.  Families look a lot different today than they did 30 years ago, and so do our jobs.  The movement of women into the workforce has produced enormous economic growth over the past few decades. But with women now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families--there's more urgency than ever to make it easier for Americans to be good workers, good parents, and good caregivers, all at the same time.  The old model of work where you could expect to hold a steady job with good benefits for an entire career, is long gone. People in their 20s and 30s have come of age in an economy that's totally different. And a lot of young parents are discovering just how tough that is on families. Many people now have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they cobble together part-time work, or they've tried to go independent.  Flexibility can be good, but you shouldn't have to worry that your family could lose your health care or retirement savings just because you change jobs or start a small business.  Why do you think every other--I have to ask--why do you think every other advanced country has paid family leave? Do you think they are just unrealistic, or do you think that they have figured out they can have a stabler economy, they can support families? And that's what I want us to do. Working families need predictable scheduling, earned sick days and vacation days, quality affordable childcare and healthcare. These are not luxuries. They're economic necessities.  In today's economy, benefits should be flexible, portable, and comprehensive for everyone.  That means it's time to expand Social Security as well. Especially, especially for older women who are widowed, or have taken time out of the workforce to care for a loved one, and who are suffering financially because of that. We need to look to a secure retirement for everyone, and to provide families relief from crushing costs and health care, housing, and prescription drugs. I looked at the numbers and in some states, two parents earning the minimum wage have to spend up to 35 percent of their income on child care.  For a single parent, it could be 70 percent. So I will set a goal: Families shouldn't have to pay more than 10 percent of their income for child care. And I will repeat today what I have said throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on the middle class I will give you tax relief to raise these burdens.  Now, you know whenever I talk about these family issues, Donald Trump says I'm playing the "woman" card. Right? Well you know what I say, if fighting for child care and paid leave and equal pay is playing the woman card, then deal me in.  Here's what I want you to understand. It may be difficult to imagine all this getting done and Washington is so broken, I get that--but I really think that progress is possible or I would not be standing up here running to be president of the United States.  I know Republicans and Democrats can work together, because I've done it. As you heard Alicia say, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program when I was first lady. That happened with support with both parties. And it now it covers 8 million kids and when you go to get health care for your child, nobody says, "Are you a Republican or Democrat?" They say, "What does your child need?"  I worked with Republicans many times when I was a senator from New York and as secretary of state, so I know we can get results that will make real differences in people's lives.  I know however it's rare. There's no question that we need to make Washington work much better than it does today. And that means in particular: getting unaccountable money out of our politics.  One of the reasons this election is so important is because the Supreme Court stands in the balance. We need to overturn that terrible Supreme Court decision, Citizens United, and then go a lot further to reform our whole campaign finance system.  This is about our democracy--but it's also about our economy. Campaign finance reform and reducing the power of special interests is directly relevant to getting Washington working for the people again--making the right investments, putting your jobs and your economic security first.  That's why I'm so passionate about this issue, and I'm will fight hard to end the stranglehold that the wealthy and special interests have on so much of our government.  So, let's do this together. A historic investment in jobs. Debt-free college. Profit sharing. Making those at the top pay their fair share. Putting families first in our modern economy. And a democracy where working people's voices are actually heard. That is what we are fighting for in this election.  As I said during the primary I am a progressive who likes to get things done and we can do this.  Just for a minute, compare what I am proposing to what we hear from Donald Trump. The self-proclaimed "King of Debt" has no real ideas for making college more affordable or addressing the student debt crisis. He has no credible plan for rebuilding our infrastructure, apart from his wall. He has no real strategy for creating jobs, just a string of empty promises. Maybe we shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are, "You're fired."  Well, here's what I want you to know: I do have a jobs program. And as president, I'm going to make sure you hear, "You're hired."  Here's the bottom line: Economists left, right, and center all agree Donald Trump will drive America back into recession. Just this week, one of Senator John McCain's former economic advisors said Trump's policies would wipe out, wipe out three-and-a-half million jobs. His tax cuts tilted toward the wealthy would add more than $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years.  That is just astonishing and it's no wonder that the Economist Intelligence Unit, one of the leading firms that analyzes the top threats to the global economy, now ranks a Trump presidency No. 3, right behind problems in China and volatility in the commodities markets.  Look, I know Donald Trump hates it when anyone points out how hollow his sales pitch really is. I guess my speech yesterday must have gotten under his skin because right away he lashed out on Twitter with outlandish lies and conspiracy theories, and he did the same in his speech today.  Now think about it. He's going after me personally because he has no answers on the substance. In fact, he doubled down on being the King of Debt.  So all he can do is try to distract us. That's even why he's attacking my faith, sigh. And of course attacking a philanthropic foundation that saves and improves lives around the world.  It's no surprise he doesn't understand these things. The Clinton Foundation helps poor people around the world get access to life-saving AIDS medicine.  Donald Trump uses poor people around the world to produce his line of suits and ties. Here in North Carolina, you know as well as anyone that our economy is already too unpredictable for working families. We can't let Donald Trump bankrupt America the way he bankrupted his casinos. We need to write a new chapter in the American Dream--and it can't be Chapter 11.  Please, join me in this campaign, I'm offering a very different vision. We're stronger together. We're stronger when we grow together. We're stronger when our economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. I am convinced that if we work hard if we go into November with the confidence and optimism that should be the American birthright, we will not only win an election, we will chart the course to the future that we want and deserve.  Thank you and God bless you. Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you all. I have to say, pink never looked so good.  I want to thank my friend, and your courageous leader, Cecile Richards. Cecile really is the definition of grace under pressure. She has proven that time and time again over the course of her career, particularly over the last few years. She really is like another great American, her mother, Ann Richards, who was a friend of mine, and I just wish Ann were here to see this election. She'd have Donald Trump tweeting double time.  We reached a milestone together this week. Thanks to you, and people all over our country, for the first time, a woman will be a major party's nominee for President of the United States.  And yesterday, I had the great honor of being endorsed by President Obama and Vice President Biden. And by Senator Elizabeth Warren.  So it's been a big week. And there's nowhere I'd rather end it than right here, with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.  I'm grateful to the entire Planned Parenthood family. You made this campaign your own. Whether you knocked on doors in Iowa or rallied in California, this victory belongs to all of you.  It belongs to the one thousand young activists who came together in Pittsburgh last month to get organized.  It belongs to the staff, the donors, and to the providers. Providers like Dr. Amna Dermish in Texas, who called out Donald Trump when he said women should be punished for having abortions. And the open letter she wrote defending her patients' right to make their own health decisions should be required reading for every politician in America.  I am deeply conscious of the reality that this victory belongs to generations of brave women and men who fought for the radical idea that women should determine our own lives and futures.  And it belongs to the women and men who continue to fight for that idea today, even in the face of threats and violence.  When a man who never should have had a gun killed three people at Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs, leaders in this room voted unanimously to keep health centers across America open the next day. The CEO, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountains made a promise to patients in Colorado and beyond when she said: "Our doors -- and our hearts -- stay open.'  That is really what Planned Parenthood is all about.  So today, I want to say something you don't hear often enough: thank you.  Thank you for being there for women, no matter their race, sexual orientation, or immigration status.  Thank you for being there for Natarsha McQueen in Brooklyn, who told me how Planned Parenthood caught her breast cancer when she was just 33 years old, and saved her life.  Thank you for being there for college students getting STD testing. The young people who have the tough questions that they're afraid to ask their parents. The sexual assault survivors who turn to Planned Parenthood for compassionate care. The transgender teens who come for an appointment and find the first place where they can truly be themselves.  Thank you for being there for your communities -- whether that means taking on hostile politicians in Louisiana or handing out clean drinking water in Flint, Michigan.  And thank you for being there for every woman in every state who has to miss work; drive hundreds of miles sometimes; endure cruel, medically unnecessary waiting periods; walk past angry protesters to exercise her constitutional right to safe and legal abortion.  I've been proud to stand with Planned Parenthood for a long time. And as president, I will always have your back.  Because I know for a century, Planned Parenthood has worked to make sure that the women, men, young people who count on you can lead their best lives -- healthy, safe and free to follow their dreams.  Just think when Planned Parenthood was founded, women couldn't vote or serve on juries in most states. It was illegal even to provide information about birth control, let alone prescribe it.  But people marched and organized. They protested unjust laws and, in some cases, even went to prison. And slowly but surely, America changed for the better.  51 years ago this week, thanks to a Planned Parenthood employee named Estelle Griswold, the Supreme Court legalized birth control for married couples across America. When I used to teach law, and I would point to this case, a look of total bewilderment would come across my students' faces. And not long after that, Roe v. Wade guaranteed the right to safe, legal abortion.  So young women were no longer dying in emergency rooms and back alleys from botched, illegal abortions. And this is a fact that is not often heard, but I hope you will repeat it: America's maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically.  And it turns out, being able to plan their families not only saved women's lives, it also transformed them -- because it meant that women were able to get educations, build careers, enter new fields, and rise as far as their talent and hard work would take them -- all the opportunities that follow when women are able to stay healthy and choose whether and when to become mothers.  And you know so well, today, the percentage of women who finish college is six times what it was before birth control was legal. Women represent half of all college graduates in America and nearly half our labor force.  And our whole economy, then, is better off. The movement of women into the workforce, the paid workforce, over the past 40 years was responsible for more than three and a half trillion dollars in growth in our economy.  And here's another fact that doesn't get much attention: unintended pregnancy, teen pregnancy, and abortion rates are at all time record lows. That reality and studies confirm what Planned Parenthood knew all along: Accurate sex education and effective, affordable contraception work.  And, it wasn't so long ago, Republicans and Democrats could actually stand together on these issues. Back in the "90s, when I helped create the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, I worked with Republicans to get it done.  Now things feel quite a bit different now, don't they?  Instead of working to continue the progress we've made, Republicans, led now by Donald Trump, are working to reverse it.  When Donald Trump says, "Let's make America great again,' that is code for "let's take America backward.' Back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some, not all. Back to the days when abortion was illegal, women had far fewer options, and life for too many women and girls was limited.  Well, Donald, those days are over.  We are not going to let Donald Trump or anyone else turn back the clock.  And that means we've got to get to work. Because as you know better than anyone, right now, across the country, rights that women should be able to take for granted are under attack.  Any day now, the Supreme Court will rule on the Texas law that imposes burdensome and medically unnecessary requirements on abortion providers. If these restrictions are allowed to stand, 5.4 million women of reproductive age will be left with about 10 health centers that provide abortion -- in a state the size of France. It is the biggest challenge to Roe v. Wade in a generation.  It's also yet another reminder of what's at stake on the Supreme Court. President Obama has done his job, and nominated Merrick Garland to be the ninth justice. It's time for Senate Republicans to do their job. The Senate should give Judge Garland the hearing he deserves.  Now, meanwhile, in just the first three months of 2016, states across the country introduced more than 400 restrictions on abortion. 11 states have defunded Planned Parenthood in the last year, cutting some women off from their only health care provider. And of course, on a national level, Republicans in Congress have been willing to shut down the entire federal government over Planned Parenthood funding.  Have you ever noticed that the same politicians who are against sex education, birth control, and safe and legal abortion, are also against policies that would make it easier to raise a child -- like paid family leave?  They are for limited government everywhere except when it comes to interfering with women's choices and rights.  Well I'm here today to tell you we need to be just as determined as they are.  We need to defend Planned Parenthood against partisan attacks. If right-wing politicians actually cared as much about protecting women's health as they say they do, they'd join me in calling for more federal funding for Planned Parenthood.  We also need to fight back against the erosion of reproductive rights at the federal, state, and local levels, and ensure that patients and staff can safely walk into health centers without harassment or violence.  We need to, we need to stand up for access to affordable contraception, without interference from politicians or employers. And let's invest in long-acting reversible contraceptives, so every woman can choose the method that is best for her. Let's strengthen and improve the Affordable Care Act, which covers 20 million Americans and saves women millions of dollars through no-copay preventive care.  Let's take action to stop the spread of the Zika virus, which threatens the health of children and pregnant women.  Let's repeal laws like the Hyde Amendment that make it nearly impossible, make it nearly impossible for low-income women, disproportionately women of color, to exercise their full reproductive rights.  And, it is worth saying again: defending women's health means defending access to abortion -- not just in theory, but in reality. We know that restricting access doesn't make women less likely to end a pregnancy. It just makes abortion less safe. And that then threatens women's lives.  For too long, issues like these have been dismissed by many as "women's issues' -- as though that somehow makes them less worthy, secondary.  Well, yes, these are women's issues. They're also family issues. They're economic issues. They're justice issues. They're fundamental to our country and our future.  Beyond these specific issues, we need to keep working to support women and families in other ways -- by getting incomes rising, including the minimum wage, which disproportionately affects women; we need to finally guarantee equal pay for women's work; we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that keeps families together; and we need to break down all the barriers of discrimination and systemic racism that hold too many Americans back.  We need to come together to stop the epidemic of gun violence that is stalking our country. No parent should live in fear that their child will be hurt or killed by gun violence. 33,000 Americans are killed every year. I've met so many mothers on this campaign who have lost their own children. We owe it to them to protect our kids no matter what ZIP code they live in. And that is going to require standing up to the gun lobby and making this a voting issue.  All the issues we're talking about today are connected. They intersect. And that's why I'm grateful to the reproductive justice leaders in this room and across America. Because you know that all those issues go straight to that fundamental question: whether we believe women and families of all races and backgrounds and income levels deserve an equal shot in life.  Now that's what I believe and you won't be surprised to hear -- Donald Trump believes something very different.  He actually thinks guaranteeing paid family leave would leave America less competitive. He says if women want equal pay, we should just -- and this is a quote -- "do as good a job' as men -- as if we weren't already.  He wants to appoint justices who want to overturn Roe V. Wade. He of course wants to defund Planned Parenthood. And he wants to go after so many of the fundamental rights we have, including safe and legal abortions. And he actually said, "women should be punished for having abortions.' Now, once he said that there was an outcry, as there should have been, and he tried to walk back his comments. He's doing that a lot lately.  But anyone who would so casually agree to the idea of punishing women -- like it was nothing to him, the most obvious thing in the world -- that is someone who doesn't hold women in high regard. Because if he did, he'd trust women to make the right decisions for ourselves.  But don't worry. Donald assures us that, as President, he'll be -- and I quote again -- "the best for women.'  Anyone who wants to defund Planned Parenthood, and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what's best for women.  And after all this is a man who has called women "pigs,' "dogs,' and "disgusting animals.' Kind of hard to imagine counting on him to respect our fundamental rights?  When he says pregnant women are an "inconvenience' to their employer, what does that say about how he values women -- our work, our contributions?  We're in the middle of a concerted, persistent assault on women's health across our country. And we have to ask ourselves and ask everyone we come in contact with: Do we want to put our health, our lives, our futures in Donald Trump's hands?  Now, these questions aren't hypothetical. Every woman -- and everyone who cares about women -- will answer them when they vote in November.  When I talk like this, Donald Trump likes to say I'm playing the "woman card.' And I like to say, if fighting for equal pay, Planned Parenthood, and the ability to make our own health decisions is playing the woman card, then deal me in.  Now my friends, I come to this issue, of course as a woman, a mother, and a grandmother now. But I also come to it as a former First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State. And in those roles, in those roles, I traveled to parts of the world where girls are married off as soon as they are old enough to bear children. Places where the denial of family planning consigns women to lives of hardship.  I visited countries where governments have strictly regulated women's reproduction -- either forcing women to have abortions or forcing women to get pregnant and give birth.  Everything I have seen has convinced me that life is freer, fairer, healthier, safer, and far more humane when women are empowered to make their own reproductive health decisions.  And everything I've heard from Donald Trump, often seems to echo other leaders who have a very different view of women.  The late, great Maya Angelou said: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.'  Donald Trump has shown us who he is. And we sure should believe him. It's not just on reproductive rights. Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues we care about -- economic justice, workers' rights, civil rights, human rights, the environment--all of that is on the line in this election.  When Donald Trump says a distinguished judge born in Indiana can't do his job because of his Mexican heritage, or mocks a reporter with disabilities, or denigrates Muslims and immigrants, it goes against everything we stand for. He does not see all Americans as Americans.  So this election isn't about the same old fights between Democrats and Republicans. They'll be there, don't worry. But this election is profoundly different. It's about who we are as a nation. It's about millions of Americans coming together to say: We are better than this.  So here's my promise to you today: I will be your partner in this election and over the long haul.  Together, we are taking on the attacks and together we'll come out stronger -- just like Planned Parenthood has, time and again.  And together we're going to unify our country, stop Donald Trump, and fight for an America where we lift each other up, instead of tearing each other down.  We're not just going to break that highest and hardest glass ceiling. We're going to break down all the barriers that hold women and families back.  We're stronger when every family in every community knows they're not on their own. We are stronger together and we are going to make history again in November.  Thank you all so, so much. It is so great to be here as you gather and take Detroit by storm. I am so honored to be here, to congratulate all of you on the incredible progress you continue to make under your president Mary Kay Henry, secretary-treasurer Gerry Hudson, and all of your executive vice presidents.  You know, standing behind me are some of the SEIU members that I've had the great honor of meeting over the past year.  Thank you, Terrell, for sharing your story. I was so touched by what you had to say and the others with whom I met just from Chicago, to L.A. to New Haven and places in between to hear what you do, how you do it, how you love doing it. But how it's becoming impossible to continue the work you love, in childcare or home health care, if you do not have a living wage.  I am here to tell you that I join with you to do everything we can to make sure that the men and women of SEIU who are providing care for our children, our elderly, people with disabilities, you all have a living wage.  I do sort of wish that the presumptive Republican nominee could have been around to hear the stories that I heard. Maybe then he wouldn't say wages are too high in this country. Maybe he would finally open his ears and listen to what working people everywhere are saying that America needs a raise!  I really can't think of a better way to start the week than standing with the brothers and sisters of SEIU. You keep America healthy, care for our loved ones, help people with disabilities live independently. You keep our cities, our states, and our schools running. You clean our buildings, and protect our communities.  So today, I want to say something that I don't think you hear enough: Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I know that you are often unsung heroes. And I want you to know this: Your fights are my fights. Just like the theme of this conference says: "Together, we are unstoppable."  I'm thrilled to see so many friends from my home state of New York here today. And friends from across the country who have helped me in this primary campaign. You braved the snow in Iowa and the rain in South Carolina, you've knocked doors in New Hampshire and got on buses to come to Nevada. Everywhere I go these days, the purple t-shirts are out in force. Like a lot of great things about America, this campaign is union-built, and I could not be prouder.  You've had my back--and I will always have yours.  Because as I've traveled the country I've had the chance, really the privilege and talked with health care workers, home care workers, childcare workers, fast food workers, airport workers, and janitors, and nurses. I've heard again and again: There has never been more at stake for working families in America than right now.  This election, my friends, from where I stand is about knocking down all the barriers that hold families and workers back. Building ladders of opportunity in their place. Coming together to get incomes rising and creating more good jobs that provide dignity and pride.  That's what SEIU has always fought for. And with your help, we are going to win in November.  I am the granddaughter of a factory worker who operated a loom at the Scranton Lace Works in Pennsylvania. My father put everything he had into a small fabric printing shop in Chicago. My mother was out on her own working as a housemaid at the age of 14.  I grew up respecting the dignity of hard work and what it takes to provide a good, middle class life, where you really can believe that your children will be better off than you have been.  So that's why I believe that when unions are strong, America is strong. There is no doubt, although some may question it, unions helped build the strongest middle class in the history of the world. SEIU is not only part of that noble tradition, you've been on the frontlines of the fight for affordable health care, safe working conditions, and fair, predictable schedules. And today, you're leading the movement to raise the minimum wage, which will lift 35 million working Americans out of poverty.  In fact, the American labor movement pioneered the basic bargain that made our country great: If you work hard and you do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.  You're not just fighting for your members--you're fighting for all working families. And I'm proud to be in the trenches fighting alongside you. Because I also know strong families are the backbone of our economy and our country.  So to everyone here, to all of you who have ever faced a hostile legislature, a union-busting governor, or both: Help is on the way.  We are going to defend the right to organize, protect collective bargaining. Let's make the jobs of the future good union jobs that can't be outsourced. And let's say what we all know: "right to work' is wrong for workers, and wrong for America.  I know that and you know that and it's time we make sure everyone knows that. Because thanks to the determination and sacrifice of working people like you all over this country--and because of the leadership of President Obama--we've worked our way back from the worst financial crisis in a generation. You see, I don't think the President gets the credit he deserves for saving our economy.  But our work is far from finished.  I've heard from so many families who are still struggling. Corporate profits keep going up, and so do everyday living expenses, but paychecks for most people still are not growing the way they should. Too many families worry about how to keep the lights on and the rent paid. Parents run themselves ragged trying to balance responsibilities at home and work.  It can be even harder for parents raising kids with special needs or chronic illnesses. Like LaTonya Allen, a homecare worker I met from Atlanta. Her 29-year-old daughter has cerebral palsy. LaTonya is working around the clock to support her family on $9 an hour. She has no benefits, no vacation, no sick days--so when she got hurt on the job, she went to work on crutches, with a broken bone in her hip.  She is not asking for life to be easy. It ain't no crystal staircase; she knows that. But no one should have to choose between taking care of their health or paying the bills. LaTonya works so hard, she works hard to do right by her family. She deserves a country that will do right by her. That is what's at stake in this election.  Because the families I've met across the country come from different backgrounds, they earn different incomes, but they all desperately want to give their kids a good life. And they're up against pressures and problems too big for them to solve on their own.  In many ways, our economy and our workplaces are built still for a different time, when many moms stayed home, when one parent could earn enough to support a family. Don't you think it's time, finally, that we catch up to how American families actually live and work in today's world? Well I sure do, that's why I have been laying out an agenda and I thank SEIU for helping me with that agenda, Mary Kay.  First, we've got to do more to raise families' incomes. Let's start by raising the federal minimum wage. And let's support local efforts to go even higher. I am proud to stand with SEIU and workers across the country organizing in the fight for $15 and a union. Every worker everywhere in America deserves a fair wage and a voice on the job. So thank you for leading this fight, because "when we fight, we win."  Let's also fight for paid family leave. Too many moms, and a lot of them right here today, too many moms have to go back to work just days after their babies are born--like the homecare worker I met from Minnesota, who had to return a week after having a C-section. How else was she going to put food on the table for a toddler and a new baby? And too many dads and parents of adopted children don't get any paid leave at all. Neither do sons and daughters struggling to take care of their aging parents.  None of this is fair to families. Donald Trump may not care--but we do. And so do working families across our country. We know America is better than this.  So let's finally guarantee equal pay for women. After all, it's 2016. Don't you think it's about time? When a woman is paid unfairly and unequally that doesn't just shortchange her--it shortchanges her whole family.  Let's encourage more employers, both in the private and the public sector, to embrace family-friendly policies, like predictable scheduling.  Together, we'll do whatever we can to fight to finally put quality childcare within the reach of every family.  You know that in many states, childcare is more expensive than rent, it's more expensive even than college tuition. That puts parents in an impossible position.  Just ask Artheta Peters from Cleveland, Ohio. She loves her job caring for an 8-year-old with a muscle disease. But she doesn't earn enough to afford childcare for her own children, so she's forced to leave them at home with an older sibling. It breaks her heart, but she doesn't have a choice.  In fact, in some states, two parents earning the minimum wage have to spend about 20 percent of their income on childcare. For a single parent, it's 40 percent. That is way too high.  Let's make it so no family ever has to spend more than 10 percent of their income for childcare.  And let's give childcare workers a raise. Right now, dog trainers are paid more than childcare workers. Look, I believe in training dogs, but you don't dress your dog up and send your dog to kindergarten, do you? You don't dream of sending your dog to college, do you? You don't worry about whether your dog is going to be exposed to dangerous influences because you can't afford quality childcare, do you? This is crazy, there's nothing more important than our children.  When I sat down with SEIU members in Chicago, I heard one heartbreaking story after another from parents who can't afford to give their own children the care that they give other people's kids every day. So as president I'll support states and cities that take steps to increase pay for childcare providers and early educators, we're going to make childcare more affordable at the same time for families.  I will also launch a Care Workers Initiative across every level of government. Over and over again, homecare and childcare workers that I've met with across the country have told me they want more chances to increase their skills. Let's work together to create more opportunities so that workers who are caring for others can grow in their jobs and fight for fair wages. Let's give them a chance to come together to make their voices heard and we have a stronger, better system for the people who do this vital work.  And if we're serious about doing all of this and supporting families, we have to be serious about facing up to the reality of systemic racism. And that means dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline once and for all.  We have a moral obligation to fight for justice and equity everywhere, and that includes ending, ending the era of mass incarceration, rebuilding the trust between law enforcement and communities, and putting a stop to the horror of young African Americans being killed by or dying in police custody.  We owe that to our children, and we owe it to the parents whose children have been so tragically taken from them.  That's why I'm proud that SEIU members across the country are standing up for criminal justice reform and calling for environmental and economic justice for every community. I will be right by your side, every step of the way.  And there's one more thing that I want you to help on and that is ending the epidemic of gun violence that kills 33,000 Americans a year. We need comprehensive background checks, to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole, close what's called the Charleston loophole. Stop the unaccountability of gun makers and sellers.  Saturday, Saturday night I was in Fort Lauderdale, with mothers who have lost their children to gun violence, including Trayvon Martin's mother. There were mothers from Chicago and Washington, from New York and Sandy Hook. Mothers joined together, not only in grief and loss, but in courage and resolve. They're going to do everything they can and I am going to help them every way I can. I am committed to doing all we must to help say lives. And I'll tell you right now, the gun lobby doesn't intimidate me and it shouldn't intimidate anybody.  Supporting all families in all ways is a necessity.  And when I talk about families, and what I want to see us do to stay true to our values and give every single person in this country a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. Mr. Trump likes to say I'm playing the "woman card."  Well, you know what I say: if fighting for equal pay, and paid family leave, and raising the minimum wage and affordable childcare, is playing the woman card, then deal me in.  It shouldn't surprise us that he has a very different take on all this. At a time when families are struggling to pay for childcare and so much else, Donald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are being paid too much. He actually talked, here this because you need to tell your friends, he actually talked about getting rid of the national minimum wage altogether. Shouldn't be surprising, he's hired union-busters to break up organizing campaigns on the properties he owns.  But we're not talking about any ordinary anti-union, anti-worker Republican. A lot of Republicans themselves say Donald Trump is a disaster waiting to happen to America. What little we know of his economic policies would be from running up our debt, to starting trade wars, to letting Wall Street run wild--all of that could cause another crash and devastate working families and our country. Trump economics is a recipe for lower wages, fewer jobs, more debt. He could bankrupt America like he's bankrupted his companies.  Ask yourself, how could anybody lose money running a casino? Really?  And that's not all. I hear every day from families who are afraid of what a Donald Trump presidency would mean for millions of immigrants living and working in America.  16 million people in America are part of what's called "mixed status" families, where some loved ones are citizens and some aren't. Maybe the children were born here but one or both parents are undocumented. I'm sure some of you have families like that. These are not just statistics, are they? We're talking about real people--men, women and children. We're talking about neighbors, coworkers, and friends.  A few months ago in Las Vegas, I met a 10-year-old girl named Karla Ortiz. She started to cry as she told me that her parents had a letter of deportation, and she was scared they would be taken away from her.  In a lot of ways, Karla is a typical, bright fifth grader. She loves science experiments, math, and Charlotte's Web. But she leaves for school every day terrified that her mom and dad who are working hard to support their family, won't be there when she gets home. Her parents had to take her to a heart specialist, who explained that living in constant fear was making her little heart beat dangerously fast.  When Donald Trump talks about deporting 11 million immigrants, he's talking about ripping apart families like Karla's. He's talking about sending a "deportation force" to schools, workplaces, and homes to round up moms, dads, grandparents, even children.  When he talks about ending birthright citizenship, he's talking about kicking children who are born here out of the only country they know.  When he calls immigrants rapists and murderers, he's talking about families like Karla's and many of yours.  The most important measure of any society is how we treat those at the beginning, our children, and those at the end, the elderly. What kind of country would we be if we let Donald Trump rip our families apart?  We have to reject this wrong vision for America with one strong, clear voice. We have to stand up for hardworking American families--and that includes hard-working immigrant families. Moms and dads should be preparing their kids for their futures--not for the possibility that they could be hauled away at any moment.  In my first 100 days as president, I will introduce comprehensive immigration reform. And I will build, I will build on President Obama's executive actions and keep going, fighting every day to fix our broken immigration system and keep families together.  These are just some of the reasons this is one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. The only thing standing between Donald Trump and the Oval Office is all of us.  We are coming to the end of the Democratic primaries. I applaud Senator Sanders and his supporters for challenging us to get unaccountable money out of our politics; we are going to take on the crisis of income inequality. And we are going to unify the Democratic Party and stop Donald Trump.  There is so much more that unites than divides us. And we're going up against a candidate who will pull us backwards on every issue we care about.  We need a president who will use the bully pulpit to stand up for working families--but the last thing we need is a bully in the pulpit.  And nobody knows better than a union like SEIU that the only way to stand up to a bully is together.  That is, that is what I want to do with all of you; it's what unions are about. It's what I've been about my entire life, ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. We're going to have each other's back. We're going to lift each other up. We're going to leave no one behind. We're going to build a better future not just for yourselves, but for the hardworking people and their children across America. That's how we will be our best.  The lesson of the labor movement, the lesson of America's history, through good times and hard times, is that we are stronger together. So let's keep fighting, let's keep working, let's win an election in November and make sure our country is the country that we know represents our best values, not our worst.  Thank you, and God bless you.  Good evening. What a great honor it is for me to be here with all of you, and to have a chance to see some of the mothers that I've gotten to know over the last months and to meet others of you who are here for this weekend.  I think it's fair to say that the program has already been amazing. Just here during dinner--and I know you had other sessions this weekend--but here during dinner, I have to say that Rebecca Vaughns was just astonishing. And Jill Tracey kept us all in line. I don't know if you could notice where you were sitting, but she has on the coolest-looking red tennis shoes--underneath that elegant, long, flowing black dress. And Queene Thompson Brown spoke to our hearts. Just unleash that, because you have a powerful message.  I want to thank La Vie. I want to thank Minister Wanda Johnson, and Pastor Gregory Williams, and Kat Tynes. Kat Tynes has on the highest high heels I think I've ever seen. I was just knocked over when Kat came up here. They sparkle, but they're like a foot high. I had to give up wearing high heels 10 years ago. I am so jealous.  But the sisterhood that is here is so overwhelming in its love, and I am grateful to see all of you and it in action. I want to thank Sybrina and her entire family, who stand behind her, for bringing us together. Trayvon's parents, Sybrina and Mr. Tracy Martin, and his brother, Jahvaris, and his grandmother--because as Sybrina said, she's from a line of strong women, and I've met Marion Evans, for the first time in South Carolina, and am happy to see her again tonight--have demonstrated what it really means to have a family in the worst of times.  I appreciate the elected officials who are here, including my longtime friend, Congressman Alcee Hastings, who I've known a long, long time. And Barbara Jordan, and Dennis Moss, and Oliver Gilbert, and Dorothy Bendross Mindingall.  But most of all, I thank all the mothers and fathers, but mostly the circle of mothers, who are turning your grief into action, and so importantly, reaching out to support other parents who face the unimaginable.  I've had the great privilege of getting to know Sybrina over the last months. Even before I met her, I knew something important about her. Like a lot of people, I watched--I watched in disbelief and horror--when her son was killed.  But then I saw her talking about her love for Trayvon, urging people who were devastated by his death to make America a more peaceful place. She was joined by Trayvon's father. I can remember seeing that on television. One reporter described them as "models of grace and fortitude."  When I met Sybrina for myself, that's exactly what I saw. It takes a special kind of person to endure a loss like all of you, and then find a way to turn it into service.  That's what Sybrina has done. That's what many of you have done.  Sybrina said, "This is not something I ever wanted to do." She said, "I can't help Trayvon, but there are a lot of other Trayvon Martins I can help."  That's true for all of us. There are a lot of other young men and young women we all can help.  You see, I believe we have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what ZIP code they live in--to reduce violence, especially gun violence. To stand up against systemic racism and to promote justice and equality. I believe we owe that to our children, and we owe it to the parents who love their children more than anything, especially those whose love persists after they were so tragically taken from them.  Sybrina and I were talking at the table about the weekend that has been provided for the mothers who are here, and I had the great honor of meeting each of the mothers, the "Circle of Mothers," before we came in.  Some lost their children to gun violence.  Others died after encounters with police, or because of domestic violence.  Each mother handed me a letter. Actually, they put it in a basket--put it in a basket that Sybrina's mother, I think, made possible. They handed me that letter, and I'm going to read every single word of these letters, because each of the mothers is telling us something that we all need to hear, not just about their tragedies, but about our country.  Something is wrong when so many young people just starting their lives are dying.  Something is wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn't consider their children as precious and worthy of protection as other children because of the color of their skins.  Something is wrong when so many parents live in fear that their child will be hurt or killed, just for being a young black man in a hooded sweatshirt, like Trayvon; or listening to music in a car, like Jordan Davis, whose mother Lucy is here; or for standing in a park with her friends, like Hadiya Pendleton, whose mother Cleo is here; or simply going to first grade, like Ben Wheeler's mother knows, a student at Sandy Hook Elementary School--Ben's mother Francine is here too.  Something is very wrong, my friends. And this election gives us a chance to keep trying to make it right.  I come here tonight as a mother and a grandmother. I love my daughter and my granddaughter more than anything, and I worry about them like every mother does. I want them always to be safe.  But I also come here as someone who's been fighting for children my entire life. And I'm going to keep talking about these issues every chance I get, because there's nothing more important than protecting our children. If we fail at that, it really doesn't matter what else we get right.  So we have got to face up to all of the barriers that are denying children the opportunities they deserve, that enable people to see some children as less than what they truly are--talented, beautiful, and beloved.  We've got to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline that wrongly diverts too many kids into the criminal justice system. We've even seen an uptick--a significant uptick--in police involvement in school discipline, especially in communities of color. We're seeing an overreliance on suspensions and expulsions. Some of you may remember that video of the girl in South Carolina being thrown out of her desk and dragged across her classroom floor by a school officer. Classrooms should be safe places for all children. That should go without saying.  And yes, we need to continue to fight for criminal justice reform. Our legal system is often stacked against those who have the least power and are the most vulnerable. Let's get back to that fundamental principle: everyone benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law. And this is actually an area where a lot of Democrats and Republicans agree--we need to end the era of mass incarceration; rebuild the bonds of trust between law enforcement and communities; and do something about the horror, the tragedy of too many young African Americans being killed by police or dying in custody.  The mothers of Dontre Hamilton and Eric Garner are here tonight. They, along with Sandy Bland's mother, and so many others across the country, are doing their part to make sure no one else's children die like theirs did.  They deserve our complete and total support.  And we need to protect the health of our children, and that includes their mental health. Nearly 17 million children in America experience mental health problems. Some of those kids don't get treatment. They grow up to adults, and then they cause harm to others. We need to make sure the next generation grows up in a country where there's no shame or stigma, no barriers to anyone seeking and needing mental health care.  And, at long last, we must do something about the gun violence that stalks communities and terrorizes families. This is on the minds of every one of us here tonight as we remember all of the young people who have been lost. This problem isn't going away. Even toddlers are getting their hands on guns and shooting themselves or someone else. There have been, by last count, 23 cases of toddlers getting guns so far this year. I don't know what more evidence anybody needs in our country to know that somebody has gone terribly wrong.  We are smart enough and strong enough as a nation to figure out how to protect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, gang members, the severely mentally ill. I know we can do this.  And despite all the political noise, we are actually united on this issue. The vast majority of Americans support comprehensive background checks. In fact, the conservative pollster Frank Luntz found that 82 percent of gun owners and 74 percent of NRA members support background checks for anyone buying a gun. Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly support them. So do leaders in law enforcement.  So this isn't a matter of building popular support. We already have it. This is a matter of making elected officials do their jobs to keep our children safe.  Now, we know the gun lobby is powerful. I believe it's the most powerful lobby in Washington. And we know that some candidates will say or do anything to keep them happy.  Just yesterday at the NRA's annual convention, Donald Trump said that in his very first hour as president, heaven forbid, he would overturn President Obama's actions to strengthen background checks. Remember, President Obama took those steps after the massacres at Mother Emanuel in Charleston and Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.  Then Mr. Trump went further. He said that also on his first day in office, he'd mandate that every school in America allow guns in classrooms. Every school, he said. That idea isn't just way out there, it's dangerous. 33,000 people die from guns every year, nearly 3,000 children and teenagers among them. Parents, teachers, and schools should have the right to keep guns out of classrooms, just like Donald Trump does at many of his hotels, by the way.  This is someone running to be president of the United States of America, a country facing a gun violence epidemic, and he's talking about more guns in our schools. He's talking about more hatred and division in our streets, even about more nuclear weapons in the world. That's no way to keep us safe.  If you want to imagine what Trump's America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry. Picture more anger and fear. Ask any of the mothers here tonight if they want to live in that kind of America. Enough is enough. Unlike Donald Trump, I will not pander to the gun lobby. And we will not be silenced. And we will not be intimidated. As long as children anywhere are being killed by gun violence, we will keep fighting for our kids--because they deserve a president who stands up for them and stands with the mothers here. Their lives are valuable.  Now, there's a lot more I could say tonight about what we need to do to better serve our kids, from education to health care to jobs. But here's the bottom line: Anyone asking for your vote owes it to you to fully grapple with the real challenges facing our families and communities. We owe it to you to listen and come up with solutions--not scapegoats, solutions--that would make a difference in your children's lives.  And to the mothers and fathers who have lost children, we owe you our love, our support, our gratitude, and our promise that we will carry the memories of your sons and daughters in our hearts every day, just like you do.  One of the best experiences of this campaign for me has been getting to know Mothers of the Movement, Sybrina and so many of the other women here tonight. They are turning their sorrow into a strategy and their mourning into a movement. I've had the opportunity to sit and listen as they talk about their kids and their families. And I've seen how you gain strength from each other.  That's why tomorrow I hope you will take what you have gotten here this weekend back to your communities, to your families, to your loved ones, because it really does take a village.  It takes a village to raise a child, to protect a child, to mourn a child, and to honor a child. So we've got to stand together and lift each other up and draw strength from each other. Running for president's hard, I got to tell you. But it's nothing like what I have seen the mothers do and what I have learned from every one whom I have met. Your courage and your commitment and your leadership is inspirational to me.  I want to close with a passage from Scripture that means a great deal to me, and I know has meant a great deal to Sybrina.  Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways submit to Him, and He will make your paths straight.  We may never, never be able to understand the senseless violence that has affected the lives in this room and so many others who you are standing for across our country. But there is a path ahead of us. There is work for us to do.  And it is up to us to do that work, and to walk that path, with trust that progress is possible; with love for all our children, no matter their race or background; and with the memory of those we've lost lighting our way toward the future every child in this country deserves.  I am here tonight to say thank you to this circle of mothers, and to say God bless you all and God bless your families. Thank you so very much. Well, I, for one, could listen to Bill for a long time. His service along with all of you who have supported this center is really heartening to me because what you've done is what we all know needs to be done--providing comprehensive health care and making sure that people's needs are addressed across the full range of health. And I am thrilled to be here.  I want to recognize former Lieutenant Governor Crit Luallen. Thank you so much for being here, Crit. I also want to recognize former Secretary Audrey Haynes, former Secretary of Health and Human Services here in Kentucky. I am very grateful to them for their service, for being here, but also because they were part of the Beshear administration that did an absolutely world-class job. I don't suppose you need me to say that Kentucky's expansion of Medicaid, the Connect program, was really held up as the best example of any state's efforts. And I know that it was a real team commitment--the entire administration plus all in the health field who were working so hard to make it possible for more people in this beautiful state to have the health insurance that they deserved.  And I want to thank everyone here at Family Health Centers, which serves thousands and thousands of hardworking Kentucky families. I just met some of the people who work here. I met some of the patients. And they're all just beaming--they're so proud to be associated with such a special place. And I am determined to do what I can to help lift up and celebrate organizations like this. Nothing is more important than helping families, particularly hardworking families who need the kind of support that they get here at the Family Health Centers.  And I was thinking and several people as I was walking around were asking me about my granddaughter or they were mentioning that they had met my daughter, and it was just last Sunday that we were celebrating Mother's Day across our country, and a lot of moms were given homemade cards, maybe breakfast in bed, maybe pictures were taken. I've got a whole drawer of gifts like that. And they'll be treasured forever, but it's also important that we recognize that our country should be celebrating families every single day and doing everything we can to support families--not just with nice words but with real actions that can help parents, moms and dads, do the vital work of raising their children, which is the most important work any of us ever do.  And I've heard from thousands of families who are struggling who are trying to figure out how to get from paycheck to paycheck. They can't figure out how to pay for childcare and to put some money away for maybe college someday. They're struggling to be there for their kids, trying to succeed at home, succeed at work, and they're finding how difficult that is--how many stresses are part of it. And for some families it's even greater if they are raising kids with special needs or with chronic illnesses or they have mental health challenges in their families. And in places that have been devastated by job losses not far from here, where coal, steel and rail jobs are disappearing, raising a family becomes even harder.  I was with some moms and dads yesterday in Northern Virginia talking about the challenges that they all face--how to balance work and family--and a few brought their children with them. And we were impressed that all these children were so patient and their moms were keeping them occupied and happy. But it was really important to hear from each of them what they think they need to do the job and how they can get more help.  These moms and dads are running into the middle-class squeeze that many families face. Their relative incomes are the same or lower than they were some years ago, but the cost of everything is higher, so even with two incomes economic pressures are enormous. And one mom said she's paying $16,000 a year for childcare, which means that there's nothing to put away for college, and they're balancing their budget every week trying to make sure they've got the money they need for everything else.  Earlier, in Lexington today, I met with another group of moms and dads at the Family Care Center near the university, and just about every single one of them said how invaluable it was to have a place where they could come to get help to meet the needs of their kids, including childcare, home-visiting programs, medical checkups. That was such a relief, and a lot of them didn't even know that such a program was available until they really needed it and found their way to it. That freed them up to focus on work, knowing that their kids were in safe hands.  I hear this across the country, because so many families really don't know where to turn. And the parents I've met over the past few days and parents that I've met over the past many years may come from different backgrounds, they may earn different incomes. They're Democrats and Republicans, but they're facing the same challenges and they desperately want to give their kids a good life and they are needing help to deal with the pressures, because they can't figure out often how to solve all of this on their own.  So today, even, walking around with Bill, I met parents just very briefly who come here to this center for all of their medical and health needs. It gives them peace of mind, not just services. And that's just something every parent can understand--getting that peace of mind. I know what it was like so many years ago trying to balance family and work, when my daughter would get sick as I was on the way out the door to work, how I would find somebody to help me take care of her because, of course, if she were sick, the babysitter was also sick. And that's the kind of everyday, real challenge that families are facing.  And I want us to be really focused on what we're going to do to make it easier for families to get ahead and stay ahead. And it's going to be one of the major issues that I'm going to keep talking about because I don't think there is anything more important. I know I was lucky all those years ago that I had backup. And I know a lot of parents are trying as hard as they can.  So what can we do to get our economy and our workplaces that were, frankly, built for a different time, when you had a stay-at-home parent, predominately moms, and one income could support a family--but that's just not the way it is for the vast majority of American families any more. And so what we've got to figure out is how to move our family policy into the 21st century and to do more to help women and men find meaningful work, to earn a good living, but to take care of their most important responsibilities.  So I've been thinking a lot about what we can do. How do we make government policies more efficient? How do we make them more responsive to everything that people have to do, to raise their kids and look after the home and be there to earn a living and build a career? Because I don't think we can keep going on like this. We can't keep saying, families just have to buckle down and tighten their belts and figure it out. I think belts are about as tight as they can get for the vast majority of families.  People are using every single hour of their day, and there's still not enough time to get everything done. And too many parents are lying awake at night trying to figure out how in the world they're going to make it all work. So something's got to change, and there isn't one-size-fits-all. We need a menu of options in a country as diverse as ours. And I think there are a number of things we could do that would make real differences for families.  Let's create a national system of paid family leave. Too many new parents really don't know how to handle the family responsibilities. Too many moms have to go right back to work after their babies are born, or they try to cobble together vacation days and sick days and unpaid leave, short-term disability, anything to get more time with their babies. Many don't even get a paid day off to give birth. That's just almost impossible for many people in many workplaces to believe, but it happens to be true. There is no requirement that people get earned sick days, that they get the kind of support that they need. And too many dads and parents of adopted children don't get any paid leave at all, and neither do sons and daughters who are struggling to take care of aging parents. I just don't think this is fair to families, and that we can and should do better.  California's had paid leave for a number of years. They in fact just expanded it to cover more of the pay needed and to cover more family members. And their economy's doing just fine. The arguments we all hear, like, "Oh, my gosh, you can't do that," we will structure a plan that will be sensitive to small businesses with few employees. But we've got to move with the rest of the world, the advanced economies in the world that provide paid leave programs.  I also want to expand home visiting programs nationwide. In some states, nurses, social workers, volunteers who are trained go right into the home. And we heard about a great program in Lexington. They answer questions about nursing or sleep training. They screen for health and developmental benchmarks so problems can be caught early. They emphasize how important it is to talk, read, and sing to your baby to build your baby's brain, which will better prepare your child to succeed in school. Every family deserves that support, no matter where they live. And the testimonials to the home visiting program that I heard in Lexington were just so glowing about what it meant.  I brought a home visiting program for toddlers to Arkansas called the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters, and it really works. It really helps--not only prepare kids. You know what else it does? It helps parents, predominately mothers and grandmothers, if they are caring for children, feel competent and confident in being that educator in the home that every child needs to have.  We also have to raise families' incomes. Start by raising the minimum wage at the national level, which would give--that would give millions of American families--two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women. So it would give a lot of single-parent families a much-needed boost in their income.  And then of course we have to guarantee equal pay for women's work because when--when a woman is paid unfairly, that doesn't just shortchange her. It shortchanges the whole family. And it hurts them down the road in the form of lower Social Security contributions and retirement savings. And I want to do more to encourage employers to embrace family-friendly policies, and here's just one example.  There are these new sophisticated scheduling software programs that help employers squeeze every last once of productivity out of their workforce. But they also throw their workers' families into chaos. Too many workers don't even know what shift they're working until the last minute. If they have kids, that means they're constantly scrambling to line up childcare. And how can you even plan to take your child to the doctor or go to the parent-teacher's conference or sit down at the dinner table as a family if you are working until 1:00 a.m., and then you're told you have to report back at 4:00 a.m.? And it just infuriates me because I have talked to predominately women who are on these kinds of unpredictable, absolutely back-breaking schedules.  That instability is not what families and kids need. So I want to do more to work with businesses and workers to help workers gain more control over their schedules. We cannot be sacrificing families and children for these unpredictable scheduling choices that are really not necessarily. You cannot convince me that you can't do a little better planning. In fact, if businesses can't, then there's something wrong. They need to get some help themselves because that's not a very smart organizing or managerial approach.  And then we've got to put quality childcare within the reach of every family. Right now, in many states, childcare is more expensive than college tuition. That is just a shocking figure. Now, we know that college is too expensive, and that's why I'm advocating for debt-free college. But for many families, childcare costs are even more, and it puts parents in an impossible position. Either they put their kids in a not-so-great place and spend the whole day worried and distracted, or they do whatever it takes to pay for childcare, even if it means taking on debt; or they decide they just can't afford it, so one parent stays home or they put their child in a setting they're not enthusiastic about.  And I've been talking with so many parents that are just caught in this childcare bind. And if they leave the workforce--predominately, again, the mothers--then it makes it harder to get back in the workforce and to get paid what they should have been paid anyway. And for single-parent families, these choices are even more difficult. So I think we've got a lot to do to make quality childcare affordable for all working families and to move us toward a much more family-friendly set of policies.  I looked it up, and here in Kentucky two parents earning the minimum wage have to spend about 20 percent of their income on childcare. For a single parent, that number goes up to 40 percent. Now, if we're going to say we are for family values, then we need to value families. And no family should have to pay more than 10 percent of their income on childcare. And under my plan, that would be what we would do.  And at the same time, we would work to give childcare workers a raise because despite how high the price is for families, the people who actually do the work aren't paid well at all. A lot of them are minimum wage workers, and a lot of them can't stay in the profession because it just doesn't provide enough of a living. In fact, in many places dog trainers are paid more than childcare workers. And I've talked to a lot of childcare workers who can't give their own children the care that they want them to have. And with the high turnover, it doesn't lead to the quality that any family should expect.  So I want to make childcare a profession that attracts and retains talented, qualified workers. As president, I would support states and cities that take steps to increase pay for childcare providers and early educators while at the same time making childcare more affordable for families by having a bigger government backstop. What I learned today in Lexington, they have a really great program, and they get subsidies from the state. They have a sliding scale of payment that is affordable. And that's exactly what we need to be doing for everyone.  And I want to help students who are also parents. That means getting more childcare centers on or near college campuses, like the one I visited today near UK. It also means easing the financial burdens on student parents so they don't give up on school because they can't afford it.  Back in Arkansas, I helped to start a scholarship for single parents, called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, to help defray some of the costs that single parents ran into because if your childcare falls apart, you can't go to class. If your old car that--you're living out in the country and it's the only way you can get to college dies, you can't get there because--and lots of places in Arkansas, Kentucky, and elsewhere, there's not a lot of mass transit that's going to get you to school. Right?  So we've got to do more. I'd like to do something similar to what I did in Arkansas nationwide because parents who get their degrees--their community college degrees, their four-year degrees--have better job options and better incomes down the road. So if we're serious about helping and supporting families, we've got to do more to support parents who are in school.  Now, every issue that I've mentioned, of course, matters to women. But let's remember, they matter to men, too. We need to help dads just as much as moms, and that goes for every kind of dad and every kind of mom. It shouldn't be about politics. It should be about families.  Now, having said that, we are in the middle of a presidential election right now, and there are real differences between what I believe, what we believe, and what the presumptive Republican nominee believes because at a time when families are struggling to pay for childcare and so much else, Donald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are being paid too much, not too little. He's even talking about getting rid of the federal minimum wage, leaving it totally to the states, to the mercy of Republican governors, who have already cut the minimum wage for state workers. And that's happened right here in Kentucky.  And it's troubling to me because if you're going to grow the economy, I think it's kind of obvious you want people to be making money so that they can actually spend it and put it back into the economy. Donald Trump wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Your governor is working hard to undermine what Kentucky has accomplished.  So I think with somebody like Donald Trump, you would see a race to the bottom across our country, with working families paying the price. And I don't think that's a risk we can afford. So we have to reject that vision and instead come up with a much more positive one for families and children.  I love being here at this center because I can see how patient-oriented and family-oriented you are. And I've fought for a very long time for childcare and paid leave and early learning. And I've done it because, obviously, I believe in it, and I've lived the work-family balancing act, trying to be a good mom, trying to be a good person at work. But I really believe that healthy, secure families are the foundation of a strong economy and a strong country.  So for me, this goes way beyond the specifics. And I would be so proud to be the champion of a center like this, or like the center I saw in Lexington, to carry your mission into the White House, and try to move into the 21st century with our family and health policies. I am defending the Affordable Care Act because it is working. And if somebody has a better idea, of course we will listen to it. But Kentucky did a really good job in getting people connected, and I met two people signing up just upstairs a few minutes ago. If it ain't broke, don't mess with it. Right?  And so I'm going to continue to speak out on behalf of the Affordable Care Act. And when people say they want to repeal it, they want to end it, they really can't tell you what they want to do because what they want to do will just send us back to where we were, where we had so many uninsured people, so many people suffering, so many people left out of the health care system. I think we are so much better off now than we were. And I know it gives a lot of peace of mind to mothers because we are the principal purchasers and motivators for health care. All the studies show that. We're the ones getting the checkups. We're the one urging people in the family to go to the doctor for X, Y, and Z. So we know that we need a system we can rely on.  And in order to have that system, we need a country that really values what you do here at the center, that is behind you all the way. And I've always believed, as some of you know, that it takes a village to raise a child, that we have a responsibility to support each other and create the best possible environment for kids to grow up so they, too, can thrive. Because when families are strong, America is strong. I think it's really as simple as that.  And so for me, I want to do everything I can, working with you, visionaries who have created this great comprehensive health center, to do more on behalf of all of our families. So I'm really here to say thank you for leading the way. Thank you very much. Well, thank you all for coming and having this conversation with me. It's clear that there are so many challenges facing young families today that we have to come to grips with, and we have to work together to try to find the best menu of options.  Because there is just no "one-size-fits-all'. People have different needs: childcare needs, sometimes even more--as Shanda and I were just talking about--even more challenging with special needs kids, and how we start early and provide that sort of support.  For some it's family leave, and particularly the absence of paid family leave, because that makes it more difficult to deal with everything from newborns to aging relatives. Others, it's just a continuing stress of a workplace that doesn't provide enough compensation with rising incomes. There still is a challenge with equal pay for women, which is real--it's not made up.  There are lots of concerns in the workplace that I'm hearing about increasingly--about the work day never ends, the schedules are often unpredictable. And even when you think you're gaining some control over that work day it's subject to so many variables that are out of your control, and often end up throwing big monkey wrenches into what should be your family time and your efforts to try and organize and stick with that.  So I hear about this all over the country, and I really want to talk about it and hear from you more than me talking. Because there are some obvious, maybe even typical, responses, but I'm trying to get a much broader view about what will work.  These are issues that I've worked on for a really long time, going back to my own life as a mother, a daughter, and some of the challenges there--but also in the work that I've done for the Children's Defense Fund, and other ways of trying to figure out how we have a more cohesive, and frankly welcoming, set of expectations and supports for families in today's world.  Because it's just harder, I think. It's just my take. I think costs are greater. Everything from commuting time to feeling like if you take that vacation day, you're going to be viewed as slacking off. I mean they are just--they are cultural as well as economic and structural challenges, so I'm just very interested in hearing what all of you might have to say. Hello! Hello, East L.A.! I am so happy to be here. I want to thank Yamilex, who just introduced me. Didn't she do an amazing job?  I also want to thank the elected officials who are here. We've got a great turnout--Congresswoman Judy Chu, Congressman Xavier Becerra, L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis, California State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and the president of East L.A. College, Marvin Martinez.  You know, I got to start by saying, on Cinco de Mayo, I can't think of a better place to be than right here. We're here because we all believe that we need to and we can and we must break down all the barriers that hold our people back.  And we are going to do that together because we should all rise together and share in the promise of America. And the stakes in this election have never been higher. Right?  Our next president has to meet three tests: Can you actually help families get ahead and stay ahead? Can you keep us safe? And can you bring our country together? Well, Donald Trump fails all three of those tests.  With all the challenges we face in America and in the world, we can't have a loose cannon in the Oval Office. That is a risk we cannot afford.  Now, as president, creating good jobs and raising incomes will be my number one priority.  And we will follow the lead of California and raise the minimum wage across America.  And we will guarantee equal pay for women's work. I think that's way overdue. How about you?  And we're going to also follow California's lead and make sure we have paid family leave for working families.  I will do everything I can to make the economy work for everybody, to help more people lift themselves out of poverty, lift themselves into the middle class, and go as far as their hard work and talents will take them.  I will also fight to make sure that every child has a good school and a good teacher, no matter where that child lives.  And we are going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.  I will fight for that reform, but the first thing I will do is to preserve DACA and DAPA.  We're going to end raids and roundups. We're going to keep families together.  We know we've got work to do, but I think winning the election will really set that in motion. Don't you?  We also not only have to work for comprehensive immigration reform, we have to recognize that the kind of language coming from Donald Trump is hateful--and we need to repudiate it.  Now, every election is a choice, and just yesterday, Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to create a deportation force to round up millions of people. That's actually what he said.  He has pledged in his first days in office to scrap DACA and DAPA and to finalize a design for a giant wall on the border.  Well, the best way to prevent that from happening is to make sure he never gets near the White House.  Now, I am absolutely committed to doing this, and I need your help.  We have a primary here in California. I need everybody to get focused and work hard and talk to your friends, your neighbors, your families.  We have to turn out a big vote on June the 7th.  And in fact, starting next week you can vote by mail. You can vote by going down to the City Hall or the county house and saying you want to vote. So we have to get everybody.  There are no excuses. We've got to get everybody to vote.  And I hope you will tell people their futures are at stake. I cannot imagine a starker choice.  On the economy, I mean, honestly, Donald Trump actually says that wages are too high in America. I have no idea who he's talking to. Do you? He says we shouldn't raise the minimum wage. I'd like to see him live on $7.25 an hour!  I am proud to be campaigning in California, and I am proud to have the support of so many unions, including the United Farm Workers.  I think this crowd is ready, aren't you? But I can't do it without you. That's why when you leave here you've got to keep working to reach out to as many people as you can.  I want you to go to hillaryclinton.com and join this campaign. We are competing for every vote in every state, but particularly here in California--because I know that winning big in California will put us on the path to winning big in November.  Now, you know, somebody asked me the other day--somebody said, "Well, why are you so pro-immigration? Why are you so focused on making sure that we take care of the families that are here in our country and the people who have worked so hard?"  And there is really two reasons that I want to tell you.  One, because it's right, and it's what we do as Americans. We are a nation of immigrants, and I am proud of it.  We are stronger together, and our diversity is one of our strengths. So when people condemn or scapegoat or criticize or demagogue about immigrants, I wonder--where are they living? What do they know about how we have built this country?  We are a great country in part because we are a nation of immigrants.  But there's another more personal reason. When I was about 11 or 12 years old, I was asked by my church outside of Chicago to volunteer to babysit on Saturday mornings because we had so many migrant farm workers in the fields around Chicago. If you go to Chicago now, you can't imagine that. But when I was growing up, there were so many farms. They're all developed now, you've got a huge airport, but not in those days.  And so every Saturday the parents and the aunts and the uncles would take the older children to the fields and leave the younger children there, and they needed babysitters. So I said, "Yeah, absolutely." And my mother drove me and another girl out there to the camp where the families were living. They came out of Mexico, they came up through Texas, they came up through the Midwest, they came into the Chicago area, they went up to Michigan. Then, when they finished the harvest, they stayed or they went home.  And, you know, when people think about that, I want them to think that they were working hard to make a good living for their families. Just like they are today working hard to make a good living.  And I think it's time we treated everybody in this country with respect, with kindness, with love.  And I also think we'd be a lot better off if we actually talked to each other instead of yelling at each other. Let the other side do the yelling.  We're going to be talking and rolling up our sleeves and getting to work, because it's not enough to diagnose the problem, we need to solve the problems.  So you are great to be here with me today. I love the enthusiasm and the energy. Let's keep that going through June 7.  And then, after a few days off, let's get geared up again and go to the election in November. Are you ready, East LA?  Let's have a great election. Let's shape the future we want for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren. Thank you, all, and God bless you. Thank you very, very much, and thanks to Eric Dean, president of International Ironworkers, and to Fred McCraw, who is the union steward for Local 473. I am really honored to be introduced by them because I do care deeply about the work that they do, the work that is done by building trades skilled workers across our country. And I'm especially pleased to be here at a business that works closely and productively with their union.  I want to thank everybody associated with Munster Steel, in particular Jeanne Robbins and Ron Robbins and Patricia Martin, who gave me a tour and explained what I was looking at and how it ends up in those bridges and buildings and everything that is built, and built to really survive and perform the functions that it is supposed to.  It's really great to be back here in northwest Indiana. I want to thank Mayor Tom McDermott for welcoming me back to Hammond. Thank you very much, Mayor McDermott. I also want to acknowledge Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson from Gary. Thank you for being here. I know there are other elected officials -- the sheriff, the county sheriff is here; the county treasurer; council members; state -- other state senators. I am just really greatly honored to be here with you.  I want to say something to follow up on what Eric Dean said, because it had a profound effect on me. I was a Senator on 9/11 from New York, and so I got to know a lot of the people who were directly affected -- certainly the families of the 3,000 victims, many of whom needed help; the first responders who ran toward the building when it was first -- the first building that was hit, and kept running when the second building was hit; the police, the firefighters, the EMTs and others who saved countless lives by getting people out of the towers before they collapsed.  But as Eric said, at the same time that the first responders were running toward the World Trade Center, so were ironworkers and other skilled trades workers. The ironworkers in particular. I mean, there are a legion of stories of them literally getting off the worksite they were on somewhere else in New York, New York City, in New Jersey across the river, finding their way, hoping that because of their skills, they could aid in the search and rescue. Sadly, there weren't very many people to be rescued. People either died or escaped. But the ironworkers stayed on that pile for months, first to not only aid in search and rescue and recovery, but then to begin to move the debris, the steel beams off the site to begin to clear it.  So some of the ironworkers were on that pile for many, many months. And what Eric is referring to is what became obvious within days, that being on that site, breathing that debris and that toxic air was going to cause harmful health effects. And I became aware of that from visiting with and talking to and listening to ironworkers, police officers, firefighters and others. And that's when I began trying to help them get the health care that they need.  One of my prized personal possessions is a cross made for me out of a piece of steel from the pile by an ironworker who -- with whom I was meeting in a large group to talk about what I was trying to do to make sure that their health was tended to. And he came up afterwards and said he had taken this piece of steel that had been burned, that was still showing the marks of the terrible event, and had made that cross for me. So I have a particular sense of commitment to ironworkers, really to all the building trades, because of what you do every day to build our country, but also what I saw firsthand on that terrible day of 9/11.  It's a real honor to be in this plant, a family that has committed three generations to building this business and to carrying it on. And Ron was telling me about some of the investigations that his father came up with to make this product even more effectively fabricated, whatever it might be. So it's a real reminder that we have in our country people who get up every single day and go to work to build America. It's now our challenge to figure out how we're going to keep those jobs, grow those jobs, support those businesses, support those workers, support those unions, so that we can have a renaissance in manufacturing.  I believe passionately we can do this. That is why in this campaign I have laid out specific plans for how I would bring manufacturing back to places like Hammond, how I would work with business and labor to create the conditions that would enable us to do that, because it's not enough just to diagnose the problem. We all know we're losing jobs. We all know that we are facing unfair competition. We all know that we've got forces in our own country who seem determined to undermine manufacturing for reasons that I find just absolutely absurd.  So if you're looking at what's happening, you can see people, and there are probably some in this plant, who are doing the same job as their parents did but less money and fewer benefits. They're doing everything right, but maybe they can't even find a job in their chosen profession. And it's got to be hard to be optimistic about the future. And it's clear that we're giving too many Americans, particularly working Americans, a really raw deal.  So in this campaign, it's important that people not just give speeches and get everybody riled up. You need to ask them, what are you actually going to do and how are you going to do it? Give me the specifics. Don't just give me the rhetoric and the demagoguery. And that is why I have tried to be as specific as possible.  I'm just bewildered when I hear the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, actually say that wages are too high in America; that's why he doesn't support raising the minimum wage. And Republican governors and legislatures like yours right here in Indiana are waging a relentless assault on workers' rights. And I know Ted Cruz has called for a national right-to-work law. Well, right-to-work is wrong for workers, and it's wrong for America. And it's important to stand up against these domestic efforts.  We've got two sets of challenges. We have challenges from our own country, from businesses and political leaders who don't seem to understand that we still have to make it in America. We've got to make things and sell things around the world. And then we've got unfair competition coming from outside. So I recently heard that your legislature repealed the common wage. Is that right? And it was supported by the chamber of commerce, I was told. This is in total violation of Economics 101.  I mean, how do we grow the economy if people are not being paid what they deserve to be paid for the jobs they do? We are a 70 percent consumption economy. And if we don't pay people, we don't grow the economy. That's not good for families. It's not good for businesses. It's not good for Indiana, and it's not good for America. So we're going to go right at this. It's one of the reasons why I'm a strong supporter of the prevailing wage, of project labor agreements, and other ways of making sure that the people we depend on to actually build our country get paid what they should for it.  Now, I've been following what's been happening in Indiana, and I've read about some of the very large layoffs and the jobs being moved out of Indiana, even moved out of our country. I've read about Carrier. And I've got a set of plans that will incentivize companies who treat workers like the assets they are, not costs to be cut. And it is important that we do everything possible to make any company that shifts jobs overseas pay back any tax benefits they got from the American people.  Now, Carrier in Indianapolis plans to close down operations and lay off 1400 workers. UTEC in Huntington is laying off around 700 more. And that is just six months after their parent company spent $12 billion on stock buybacks for shareholders. And I stress that point because there are a lot of folks who think they know that all of this is caused by trade agreements.  And I believe trade agreements contribute to it, but it's also caused by quarterly capitalism, by activist shareholders, by company CEOs who don't put their workers, their long-term success and profitability, ahead of their own bonuses and the pressures that they are facing from the analysts that evaluate their stock.  So I'm saying to CEOs who think they can make a quick buck by turning their backs on our country -- the country, by the way, that made them successful in the first place -- we are not going to let you take advantage of us anymore. I'm going to stand up to both CEOs at home and China abroad. We are not going to let either one of these forces affect us. So if they invest in America, we'll stand with them. If they pay their fair share, we'll stand with them. But if they cut and run, we're going to pay a price.  So we need to have a policy coming from the very top in the White House where we don't just complain, we act, and we organize to act. And that's something that the ironworkers know a lot about, it's something that we do by looking in the long term, and that is what this company knows a lot about.  I want to just say a few words about trade and steel. One of the biggest and most important battles is over steel. China -- and other countries, but primarily China -- have been dumping artificially cheap steel into our markets to gain an unfair advantage. I really appreciate the fact that Munster Steel buys domestic steel.  &#8203;And I thank the Robbins family for that. In fact, they told me some of the steel they buy comes from a plant in Arkansas that I know quite a bit about because it was located there when Bill was governor of Arkansas.  So we've got this problem with China and other countries. And why is China doing this? Well, because demand in their own country has slowed down. But they want to keep their steel mills going because they want to keep people employed while they try to figure out what to do about their economy. Well, that's their problem, and we shouldn't let them dump it onto us.  And so what I am advocating is that, number one, they're trying to solve their domestic economic problems on the backs of American workers. It's illegal, pure and simple. Steel is crucial to our manufacturing base, crucial to our national security, and I will not let this vital industry disappear. I'm going to make the steel industry's survival one of my top priorities. Now, I've gone toe to toe with China's top leaders on some very tough issues, and as president I will go to bat for all of our trades -- for our steelworkers, our ironworkers, everyone who is absolutely looking for that kind of champion.  We are going to use every tool we possibly can against China for their illegal actions. I'm going to appoint a trade prosecutor, reporting directly to me in the White House, who will look for every possible way to prevent them from continuing this behavior. And I will have the federal government join with the trades and businesses in bringing trade cases against China. We're not going to wait for a union or a business to do it. We're going to join forces. We're going to do it together. We're going to go after the Chinese.  We are also going to reject -- one of the reasons why I came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement -- we're going to reject weak automobile rules of origin in trade deals. That gives Chinese steel and other products an unfair back door to U.S. markets. And it's important that we recognize that it can still very well be Chinese steel even if it's in a Japanese automobile. So we're going to trace all their steel. We're going to have, as I said, a trade prosecutor who's going to prosecute these cases. And we're going to send an absolute message: You're not going to get away with this anymore. When I was a Senator, I testified for our businesses, and at that time it was the steelworkers in New York, before the International Trade Commission against some of their behavior back about 10 years ago. So I am committed to standing up and being as strong in this as I possibly can.  So standing up for workers, standing up for home-grown businesses, especially standing up for unionized businesses that recognize the importance of a high-quality workforce like the people standing right there. Now, I think this is important for our whole country. It's especially important here in the Midwest. Nearly one in five jobs in Indiana is in the manufacturing sector. That's a much higher percentage than in much of the rest of the country right now. I have a plan to invest $10 billion to bring unions, workers, businesses, universities, and the government together to create new manufacturing jobs. I have what I call the Manufacturing Renaissance Tax Credit to encourage investments in communities that are hit hard by layoffs and plant closings. I want to be a good partner for cities like Hammond and Gary that are really trying to get back jobs and are making all kinds of efforts to do that.  I know, from my own experience, American workers don't quit. And I'm not about to quit on them. We're going to lift up manufacturing, and I'm going to go after those politicians and decision-makers, whether they're in Indianapolis or Washington, who have a very short-term memory. They don't understand we built this country by making things and paying the people who make them a middle class wage. The American labor movement helped to build the American middle class.  We have to bring back middle class jobs and wages. We've got to get families once again having a higher standard of living, feeling that they are able to look to a better future for themselves and their children. I don't think there is a more important issue in this explanation. I'm going to bring that message to Indiana, as I brought it to Ohio, as I brought it to New York, brought it to Illinois, brought it to all the states that I have competed in, because it's a message that I care passionately about.  So I wanted to come today and I wanted to come to a place that is really doing a great job, a great job in what you make, what you sell; a great job in working with your employees; a great job having good relationships with the Ironworkers Local. I can tell you, this is the model I want to see us have across America. And with your help, I will do everything I possibly can to make that come true. Thank you all. Wow. Thank you, Pennsylvania! What a night. I want to thank everyone--I want to thank everyone.  Thank you all so much. Wow. I just want to thank all of you, everyone who came out to vote here in Pennsylvania, and across Maryland, and Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island. I am so grateful to all our volunteers, our organizers, our community leaders. Everyone who worked their hearts out.  And I want to thank the leaders here in Pennsylvania. Thank you, Governor Wolf. Thank you, Senator Casey. Thank you, Congressman Cartwright. And thank you so much, Mayor Kenney, for your great help. And of course, I want to thank the 42nd president of the United States, my husband.  Now, with your help, we're going to come back to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention with the most votes and the most pledged delegates.  And we will unify our party to win this election, and build an America where we can all rise together--an America where we lift each other up instead of tearing each other down.  So we need you to keep volunteering. Keep talking to your friends and neighbors. Please join the more than 1.1 million people who've already contributed at hillaryclinton.com.  I know there are still too many barriers holding too many Americans back. But, despite what other candidates say, we believe in the goodness of our people and the greatness of our nation. And if anyone doubts that, just let them travel across this country, as I've done in this campaign the past year, hearing people's stories, learning about their struggles.  Listen to the quiet determination of the working parents I met last week in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. They are doing everything they can to provide opportunities to their children in an economy where there still aren't enough good-paying jobs.  Listen to the mothers who lost children to gun violence and encounters with the police. They're turning their sorrow into strategy, and their mourning into a movement--a movement for justice and dignity.  Listen to the nurse I met this weekend in New Haven, Connecticut, who worked for years to build a middle-class life and raise a family. But then, her luck changed. She was diagnosed with breast cancer and used up all her savings and her sick time. Soon, she was facing foreclosure and the prospect of losing the home she'd loved for more than 20 years.  And here's what she said to me: "My daughter and I live in fear of the day that we might come home and have a lock on the door. We're in pain. We're hurting. We were, and are, the backbone of this country--the middle class. We're not asking for a handout. We just want to be treated fairly."  And she is speaking for so many people across our country who feel beaten down, left out, and left behind. People who have worked hard and done their part, but just can't seem to get ahead--and find it tough even to get by.  Now, underneath all those worries together, we are going to come together, and we are going to solve the problems we face.  And I am aware that too many people feel at the mercy of forces too big for anyone to control, and they just worry that those of us in politics put our own interests ahead of the national interest.  The faith that we can make things better, that we can give our kids a better future than we had, is at the heart of who we are as a nation. And it's one of many reasons that being American has always been such a blessing.  And our campaign is about restoring people's confidence in our ability to solve problems together--by delivering results that help people follow their own dreams.  That's why we're setting bold, progressive goals backed up by real plans that will improve lives. After all, that is how progress gets made. We have to be both dreamers and doers.  And as a great Democratic president once said, "There is nothing wrong with America that can't be cured by what's right with America."  I believe we can create more good jobs with rising incomes--jobs that provide dignity, pride, and a middle-class life.  We can renew our democracy by overturning Citizens United.  We can lift up people and places who've been left out--from our inner cities to Appalachia, in every manufacturing town hollowed out when the factory closed, every community scarred by substance abuse, every home where a child goes to bed hungry.  That's what we Democrats believe in. That's what we know is possible. So we will build on a strong progressive tradition--from Franklin Roosevelt to Barack Obama.  And I applaud Senator Sanders and his millions of supporters for challenging us to get unaccountable money out of our politics, and giving greater emphasis to closing the gap of inequality. And I know, together, we will get that done.  Because whether you support Senator Sanders or you support me, there's much more that unites us than divides us. We all agree that wages are too low and inequality is too high. That Wall Street can never again be allowed to threaten Main Street. And we should expand Social Security, not cut or privatize it.  We Democrats agree that college should be affordable to all, and student debt shouldn't hold anyone back. We Democrats agree that every single American should and must have quality, affordable health care.  We agree that our next president must keep our country safe, keep our troops out of another costly ground war in the Middle East.  And we Democrats agree that climate change is an urgent threat. And it requires an aggressive response that can make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.  And we Democrats agree on defending all of our rights--civil rights and voting rights, workers' rights and women's rights, LGBT rights and rights for people with disabilities.  So in this election, we will have to stand together and work hard to prevail against candidates on the other side--who would threaten all those rights and pit Americans against each other.  They would make it harder to vote, not easier.  They would deny women the right to make our own reproductive health care decisions.  They would round up millions of hardworking immigrants and deport them.  They would demonize and discriminate against hardworking, terror-hating Muslim Americans who we need in the fight against radicalization.  And both of the top candidates in the Republican Party deny climate change even exits.  Now, the other day, Mr. Trump accused me of playing the, quote, "woman card."  Well, if fighting for women's health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the "woman card," then deal me in.  So, my friends, if you are a Democrat, an Independent, or a thoughtful Republican, you know their approach is not going to build an America where we increase opportunity or decrease inequality.  So instead of letting them take us backwards, we want America to be in the future business.  That's why I want you to keep imagining a tomorrow where instead of building walls, we are breaking down barriers--we are making it more likely that Americans will be part of a prosperous, inclusive, decent society.  We're imagining a tomorrow where every parent can find a good job and every grandparent can enjoy a secure retirement.  We're imagining a tomorrow where no child grows up in the shadow of discrimination or under the specter of deportation. And where every child has a good teacher and a good school, no matter what ZIP code that child lives in.  And imagine a tomorrow where any young person can graduate from college debt-free.  Or imagine a tomorrow where hard work is honored, families are supported, streets are safe and communities are strong, and where love trumps hate.  That is the future I want. I want that future for my granddaughter and for all of our children and grandchildren.  Now, think of this: Our nation was born right here in Philadelphia. Our Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed just a few blocks away. And ever since--even through dark and difficult chapters of our history--the idea of America has shone through.  At our best, we are, as Robert Kennedy said, "a great country, an unselfish country and a compassionate country."  But America's greatness is not a birthright. It must be earned by every generation.  So please join us. Join us. Go to hillaryclinton.com. Text JOIN, 4-7-2-4-6. Volunteer, contribute. Let's go forward.  Let's win the nomination, and in July let's return as a unified party. Thank you all so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Bob Casey.  Wow, it is so great to be back in northeastern Pennsylvania, to be here in Dunmore. I stopped in Scranton on my way here. I always feel so much at home. I stopped at Casa Bella restaurant. But I was running late, so my plan to actually eat dinner was kind of abbreviated.  But I said hello to a lot of people there, and I met people who said things to me like, "I knew your cousins, I knew your uncles." I had one man say, "Didn't we sled down Court Street one winter?" I said, "Could have been, could have been--I was there." Met another woman who lived next door to my grandparents on Diamond Avenue, and it just brings back a flood of the best memories and the best people, and I can't tell you ... how happy and proud I am to be back here with all of you.  I want to thank not only the senator, I want to thank the congressman. Thank you so much, Matt Cartwright. I want to thank the mayors--the mayor of Dunmore, the mayor of Scranton, who are here; the Democratic county chair and the Democratic chair of the city of Scranton. I want to thank Sandy (ph) and everybody who has helped to make this evening just such a happy occasion.  I've got my two brothers here. They love coming back, and, of course, they go every summer to Lake Winola--to the cottage that my grandfather built. So this place has a lot of not just memories but special meaning to me.  And the thing I want you to know more than anything else is I will work my heart out for the people in northeastern Pennsylvania. I will be a good partner, because we have work to do.  We have work to do to make sure we have enough good jobs with rising incomes for people willing to work to get ahead and stay ahead. And we're going to ... we're going to look for those new jobs in infrastructure jobs: our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our rail system all need work.  And I agree with Congressman Cartwright: We need passenger rail service from northeastern Pennsylvania.  So when I think about infrastructure, I think about good jobs--jobs that can't be exported, jobs that put people in this area to work, that pay a good wage so that people can get ahead.  And we're going to also look to see what we can do in advanced manufacturing, because I believe we can still make it in America, and we're going to find ways to do that.  And we need more clean, renewable energy jobs that will put people to work right here.  And we need to help small businesses. Small businesses create most of the jobs. And we're not creating enough small businesses. We've got too many obstacles in the way.  My idea about economic growth and development is: Let's knock down the barriers--the barriers that stand in the way of people being able to start businesses that will employ more people.  And we're going to work hard to raise the national minimum wage because ... you have 150,000 Pennsylvanians working for $7.25 an hour. You've got thousands more working on what's called the tipped wage.  Okay, some of you know about it, but a lot of you don't. It's kind of a secret, but here's how it works: If you're in certain jobs--like waitressing, bartending, hair salons, those kind of jobs--you can be paid as little in our country as $2.13 an hour, because, the idea is, you're going to make a lot of money from tips.  I'll tell you what, that is just a disgrace.  So if people are working full-time, they should not still be in poverty at the end of the year. And two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, and many of them are single moms taking care of their kids.  So I am going to fight to raise the minimum wage at the national level, and I'm also going to do everything I can to guarantee equal pay for women's work.  And you know why? I'll tell you: This is not just a women's issue. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who are working and they are not being paid what they should be paid compared to others, then you're getting shortchanged--your family is, the economy is.  I did an event this morning in Philadelphia with a woman named Lilly Ledbetter. Some of you know that she worked as a supervisor in a factory in Alabama for 40 years. She had a supervisor job; she was the only woman with a supervisor job. And she did not know for years that she made 40 percent less than the men doing the same job.  And as she rightly said, she and her husband were working hard, and when she and I were talking she said, "You know, when you go to the store, you don't get a women's discount because you don't get paid the same."  And now she's retired, her Social Security won't be the same, because she was not paid the same. Her 401(k) will not be the same. So this has a lot of implications for everybody and it's time we said, "Look, in America, if you do the job, you get the equal pay--men and women alike."  And we have to do more to raise everybody's pay, because nobody is getting a raise.  And we've got to make sure that we go where the money is when it comes to funding things like passenger rail.  They money's at the top. I am the only candidate running in either party who has pledged I will not raise middle-class taxes, because the middle class needs a raise, not a tax increase.  That's why I've laid out all these plans about how we're going to create jobs, how we're going to end the loopholes, get rid of the deductions that give people at the top a chance to go a lot further than anybody else.  And it is a fact that the economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House. Because everything I've just said, the leading Republicans don't agree with.  Donald Trump actually says ... he actually says wages are too high in America. I mean, honestly, I don't know who he talks to.  He ought to get out of those towers and actually come down and talk with people and listen to them.  My husband was here a week or so ago, and it wasn't ancient history. Some of us can remember, we had eight years with 23 million new jobs. And during those eight years, incomes went up for everybody--not just people at the top: middle-class families, working families, poor families. There were enough jobs, and the incomes were going up, so the median family income went up 17 percent in those eight years.  Now, it won't surprise you to hear me say I think there are some lessons we can learn from that.  And there's another lesson we can learn: Why didn't it continue? Well, because we got a Republican president, and they went back to trickle-down economics.  And pay close attention to what Trump and Cruz are saying. They want to go back to trickle-down economics on steroids. We've been down that road; it did not work.  We had a Republican president who slashed taxes for the wealthy. I was voting against it in the Senate, speaking out against it in the Senate. They took their eye off the financial markets and the mortgage markets--and we had the Great Recession, and a lot of people haven't even recovered from that.  So, for heaven's sakes, why would we go back to the failed policies that dropped us into the ditch that the Republicans dug for our country?  And I know how hard it was. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when President Obama was elected. Nine million Americans lost their jobs--multiply that by family members. Five million homes lost--multiply that by family members. $13 trillion in family wealth wiped out.  I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that ditch and putting us back on solid ground.  So we are back creating jobs, we are back with a lower unemployment rate--but we don't yet have the kind of energy that's producing the results that I want to see for the American people.  That's why we've got to build on what has been done. Don't get talked into some sort of a detour.  I love it, the Republicans--and I did listen to them during the last year, that's--I did it so you didn't have to. And you know they all say things like, "Well, it's the slowest recovery in history." That takes a lot of nerve. We wouldn't have needed a recovery if they hadn't wrecked the economy in the first place.  So I got to tell you, I don't know who they're going to end up nominating, but I'm looking forward--if I'm fortunate enough to be the nominee--to actually having a debate about economics, a debate about more good jobs, a debate about rising incomes.  I'm also looking forward to debating about education, and what we need to do to invest in education.  Every child in this country deserves a good teacher, in a good school--regardless of the ZIP code that child lives in. And we need to do more for early childhood education, so more kids are prepared when they actually get to school to learn.  And I want to be a good partner with our teachers and educators, and I appreciate them being here with their blue t-shirts on. Thank you.  And we're going to make college affordable. And I've laid out a plan about how we're going to do it, how it will work--and I know that we can actually make it happen, because it is something that now is stopping a lot of young people from starting college and completing college.  And see, my plan has debt-free tuition--but it also says to colleges, public colleges and universities: You've got to get your costs under control, you've got to take a hard look at what you are charging young people and their families.  And my opponent's plan relies on Republican governors to pay a third of the cost. Somehow, I don't think a lot of these Republican governors are going to do that.  So I don't want to make promises I can't keep. I've put forth a plan that I can deliver debt-free tuition on.  And then we've got to tackle the debt that young people already have.  How many people here have student debt? How many have ever had student debt? I meet young people with tens of thousands of dollars of student debt and really high interest rates, right? And I've got to tell you, it makes no sense.  I took out loans when I went to college and law school, but I didn't have a 10, 12, 14 percent interest rate--and I meet young people across this country who do.  So we are going to let you refinance your student debt. If you can refinance a mortgage or a car payment, you sure ought to be able to refinance your student debt. And if you pay your student debt payments every month, we're going to have a cutoff time. After 20 years, you're done--because it should not keep going for the rest of your lives.  We're also going to work to make sure that health care is affordable and that you have choices.  I'm going to defend the Affordable Care Act, because it took so long for us to get to this point. Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare. And we worked really, really hard.  But I'll just be honest with you: I got beat by the insurance companies and the drug companies. They just knocked me down.  I love it when some people running for this office talk about how they're going to take on the special interests. I've done it, and I know you've got to be prepared, you've got to be ready, and you've got to do everything you can to beat them back.  So when we weren't successful, I got up off the floor and I said, "Okay, what can I do now?" And I worked with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which insures 8 million kids.  And I know how much that meant to those families, and I meet young people who come up and thank me because they didn't have reliable health care before that program.  That's why I was so happy when we passed the Affordable Care Act, because when you've been to as many places as I have in our country, and met so many people who did not have health insurance--they made too much money to qualify for Medicaid, they didn't work for people who offered insurance, they couldn't afford the individual insurance market--that's why 20 million people have signed up so far.  But we've got to get the costs down: the copays, and the deductibles, and the prescription drug costs. And I have a very clear idea about how we're going to do that.  Now, the Republicans want to repeal it. They never tell you what they'll replace it with--because they know we won't like it, because it's just going to go back to the way it was.  If you have a preexisting condition, you're out of luck. If you're a woman, your costs are going to be more than a man's. If you're a young person, you may not have that opportunity to stay on your family's policy until you're 26. Lifetime limits will come back.  So a lot of what we've changed to actually give people a chance to get the insurance to take care of themselves would be wiped out.  And my opponent wants to start all over again. And I can tell you, we do not need another big, contentious debate about health care. We need to make what we've got work really well, and improve it, and get the costs out of an upwards spiral.  Now, I want to mention two other things, because you don't hear presidential candidates talk about these two things, and I am really determined we're going to address both.  Number one: We need more treatment for mental health problems.  I was talking to Congressman Cartwright before I came out, and we were talking about running for office and I said, "You know, there is something that is so personal. I meet people--maybe I just meet them for a minute, sometimes I talk to them for 30 minutes--but people want to tell you what's on their minds, because they're hoping that you or somebody can help. And the two things I hear the most about--yes, of course, economics, knocking down those barriers--but mental health and addiction."  And so when I shake a hand of a mother, or father, or a sister, or brother, or child, and they say, "Please do something about mental health," I know it's personal. Maybe it affects them. Maybe it affects somebody they know or they are related to.  And I cannot tell you how many of those conversations have led to somebody saying, "Please do something about the heroin and opioid epidemic."  I had a young man come up and introduce himself and say he was going to vote for me. I said, "Well, do you mind if I ask why?" He goes, "Yeah," he said, "I'll tell you. I played football in high school. I got really hurt my senior year. I had to have surgery. When I got out of the surgery, I was in terrible pain, and the doctor prescribed opioids."  He said, "I'm not embarrassed to tell you I got hooked, and I couldn't shake it. But I couldn't keep getting the prescription filled, so I turned to heroin," he said. He said, "I am so fortunate to be standing here, because about a year ago, I lost a really good friend who overdosed. We were in a car, we were doing heroin; he died." He said, "That just said to me I can't keep doing this, and so I went to get help."  But, he said, "It took me two months to get help." Because when you're ready to get help, there's not enough places to go to get help. And we are losing ... thousands and thousands of Americans of all age, but particularly young Americans under 40, and we have got to address this.  So I will do everything I can within our health care system to remove the stigma on mental health and to tackle the heroin and opioid epidemic.  Now, there's a lot of other important issues and concerns that we have to address in this campaign.  We've got to make sure that we have more affordable housing for people, particularly in our cities.  We've got to make sure that we have more of a diversified economy in our rural areas.  We've got to make sure we revitalize our cities, like Scranton and other places, to be magnets to attract more business.  We've got to make sure that we protect the safety net that exists.  So I will never let the Republicans privatize Social Security or Medicare. And I will never let them privatize the VA. We have to improve it and provide the services our veterans deserve to have. But we're not going to let the Koch brothers and the Republicans dismantle the VA.  We also have to be committed to do more to try to find ways where we are talking with confidence and optimism about the future, and I think that means we have to protect people's rights.  We have to protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.  We have to defend marriage equality, and end discrimination against the LGBT community.  We have to defend voting rights and end Citizens United, which is corrupting our political system.  We have to be focused on protecting workers' rights and the right to organize and bargain in a union.  Now, why is that? Because the American labor movement helped to create the American middle class.  I was meeting with some carpenters, and steamfitters, and electricians in Pittsburgh earlier today, and they were telling me about the kind of pressure that they're under by forces in the Republican party and others who are their allies to really erode the right to bargain.  And I will tell you this: You do not have to be a member of a union to want there to be unions doing that, because that raises the base for everybody.  And I'll tell you something else I will take on: I will take on the fight for commonsense gun safety measures.  And I want to be really clear about this--because I learned how to shoot a gun behind our cottage in Lake Winola, and I know how important gun ownership, and particularly hunting, is here in northeastern Pennsylvania.  And I want you to know that we can't ignore the Second Amendment--and we can't ignore that 33,000 people a year die from gun violence.  And I think we are smart enough to figure out how to do that. And the gun lobby doesn't want us to figure out how to do that. They just want to keep everybody all upset and agitated.  Well, at some point, they have to answer for that.  Responsible gun owners actually support what I am proposing: comprehensive background checks; closing the gun show loophole; closing the online loophole; closing what's called the Charleston loophole; ending the special protection that Congress voted for and gave to gun makers and sellers, which means that they don't ever have to change anything--it's the only industry in our country given that.  So there's a lot that could be done to make guns less accessible to kids. Of those 33,000, way too many are kids finding loaded guns, playing with guns, being able to pull that trigger. I mean, safety locks and other kinds of technology would save a lot of children's lives without infringing on one's Second Amendment rights.  So I'm well aware that I'm walking into the buzz saw here. I understand that. But I can tell you that when you have met as many victims of gun violence now as I have--because I have been visiting with people who have lost their loved ones for 25 years now--you either become totally insensitive, because it is too painful, or you say to yourself, "Hey, come on, we're better than this."  I was in Philadelphia the day before yesterday with mothers who have lost their children.  I was in Hartford, Connecticut yesterday on a panel with a mother from Hartford whose bright, really promising 20-year-old son was caught in some kind of crazy gang crossfire, just minding his own business.  I was there with the daughter of the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School--who went, when she heard the gunshots, to see what she could do to stop it, and was murdered.  And I was there with the mother of one of the little girls who was murdered at Sandy Hook.  And when you meet those people, as I have, when you hear their stories, can you imagine sending off your six- or seven-year-old to go to school, maybe with a little backpack--and then getting a call that a man who was clearly disturbed, and should never have had access to military assault weapons, had walked in there and murdered 20 children and six adults?  And there are lots of stories like that. And we have to make this a voting issue, and responsible gun owners have to stand up and say, "This has nothing to do with my guns, my hunting, my sport shooting, my collecting."  So I want to do this, and I also want to make a pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to keep America safe, to defeat terrorists and anybody else who threatens our country or Americans anywhere.  And here's another area where Trump and Cruz are not just saying things that are offensive--which they are--they're saying things which are dangerous, and I want you to understand this: I went to 112 countries on your behalf as secretary of state. And I know we're not going to be able to defeat ISIS unless we have a coalition that includes Muslim-majority nations. That's how we're going to do it.  And when you have someone running for president who basically says we don't want any Muslims in our country, that sends a message. And it sends a message which makes the job of building that coalition a lot harder. And when you have Ted Cruz saying, "Hey, we need special police patrols in neighborhoods where Muslims live," how that would ever work nobody can explain, but nevertheless that's what he said; and the NYPD, which I worked with closely after 9/11, because I was a senator from New York on 9/11... they were just shaking their heads hearing what Cruz was saying.  And the chief of the department said, "Well, that's an idea that doesn't go anywhere: What will we do with the 1,000 Muslim American police officers that we have on the NYPD?" And the commissioner, Bill Bratton, who has as much experience in this area as anybody, said, "Ted Cruz doesn't know what the hell he's talking about."  So look, I know some of these lines get big applause responses in these rallies that Trump has, but stop and think: "Is that smart? Does that work? Does it help us? Does it protect us?" And the answer to all of that is, "No."  And then he went even further and basically said he didn't care if more countries got nuclear weapons. I mean, we have been working--Republicans and Democrats alike; it's something that Bob Casey works on--to prevent more countries from getting nuclear weapons and having a free-for-all that brought more nuclear weapons into the world.  So I'm telling you, I'm looking forward to debating them on the economy, and I'm looking forward to debating them on national security--because we're electing a Commander-in-chief as well as a president.  So let me just close by saying this. I think one of the jobs of the next president has to take on is unifying our country. We've got too much division.  It's fine to have a back-and-forth in a political campaign. That goes with the territory. But when the politics are over, when the campaigns are done, when the elections have been held, we've got to work together.  Diagnosing the problem is not enough. We need solutions that are going to bring people to the table and actually roll up our sleeves.  And I want you to know this about me: In every job I've ever had, I have worked hard to find common ground. I did it as first lady. I did it as a Senator. I did it as secretary of state--working across the aisle, finding ways to solve problems.  And I'll tell you something else: A lot of Republicans have nice things to say about me when I'm actually working on a job, and I will probably be publicizing all those nice things as we go forward.Now, when I'm actually running for a job, oh, my gosh, they're after me from sunup to way past sundown. I get that. And they call me names and all the rest of it. I don't mind.  Because what's really important is that I do what I tell you I will do, that I want you to hold me accountable for what I will do, that we will work together across every line that divides us, that we will create a future that our children and our grandchildren can have the same opportunities that should be the birthright of any American.  I am so grateful that I was born in this country. I am so grateful that I had parents who understood hard work. I am so grateful that I have a chance to try to do the same for my grandchild.  And I want to be the champion for all of America--but particularly for our children and our grandchildren. They deserve no less.  Let's go out and please vote on Tuesday in the primary. Thank you all so much. Thank you. Wow. I am really honored to be here back in Hartford.  I am so grateful to each of these panelists, and so many in the audience, who--like me--are determined that we will do whatever we can to save lives in America.  On average, 90 people a day die from gun violence. That is 33,000 people a year. A year.  If anything else were killing 33,000 Americans a year, you can bet we would be fully mobilized, doing everything we possible could to save lives.  I'm really proud that your leaders here in Connecticut have shown the way. And I want to thank Governor Dan Malloy, who is here; Lieutenant Governor Nancy Wyman, who is here; your young mayor, who is a friend of my daughter's--which, of course, makes that even better for me--with his daughter, who is here. Thank you, Mayor Bronin, and thank you to everyone.  I want to also call out Reverend Henry Brown for his leadership as well. I know how hard it was to do what Connecticut's governor and legislature did after Sandy Hook.  So I am not here to make promises I can't keep. I am here to tell you I will use every single minute of every day, if I am so fortunate enough to be your president, looking for ways that we can save lives--that we can change the gun culture. It is just too easy for people to reach for a gun to settle their problems. It makes no sense.  And we can do this consistent with the Second Amendment. We can do this with the support of responsible gun owners. And that is exactly what we will do.  And I want you to know that I know I don't have all the answers. You will hear from the panelists today--both about their personal experiences, and about what they are doing to organize in their communities and across the nation to come up with commonsense gun safety reforms.  I'm advocating for comprehensive background checks, closing every one of the loopholes: the gun show loophole, the online loophole, what's called the Charleston loophole. Under the gun laws, you are entitled to get the gun you want to buy after three days whether or not the background check is completed.  The reason it's called the Charleston loophole is that the young killer of Charleston went to get that gun, came back three days later, the background check wasn't completed, but under the law the seller had no choice but to sell the gun. Twenty-four hours later they learned he never should have been able to buy the gun, because of his record.  But he took that gun, and he went to that venerable church in Charleston during Bible study, and he was invited in--and ended up murdering nine people.  I was in Philadelphia yesterday. There were 12 shootings in Philadelphia just over the weekend--four deaths.  A police officer, shot and injured.  And a four-year-old girl, killed when her father was playing with his loaded gun.  Because in that 33,000 deaths every year, there are homicides, to be sure, and there are suicides, and there are tragic, avoidable accidents, too many of them including children who find that loaded gun.  So it is with incredible gratitude to the people you're about to hear from that I ask you to please join us in this effort. I'm raising it everywhere I go, because we need a national movement.  They gun lobby is the most powerful lobby in Washington. You can talk about Wall Street, drug companies, insurance companies, big oil--they're all powerful, don't get me wrong.  Nobody is more powerful than the gun lobby, because they have figured out how to intimidate elected officials at all levels, who basically just stop thinking about this problem, because they're too scared to stand up to the NRA.  That's why what happened here in Connecticut really needs to be a model--to stand up, and then fight for what you have done politically, and convince a majority of people to stand with you.  That's what we have to do in Washington--and nationally. We have to turn this into a voting issue.  So we're now going to hear from the panelists, and I've asked each of them to talk about their personal story--but, also, to share their ideas about what could be done. We have a really good, diverse panel. And then, if we have time when we finish, I would love to hear from people in the audience, too. It's great to be before this representative assembly, to have a chance to talk about the issues affecting public education. Thank you Karen, Madam President, for that introduction. It is great to be here with all of you. I want also to single out someone who came with me tonight, a great champion of so many causes, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter.  You all know she is such a great fighter. ... Her absolute commitment to the issues that matter to us and to your work in America have really put her head and shoulders above anybody else. She's been just a great advocate. And for those of you in Rochester, in her congressional district, please send her back in November!  So it's great to be here in Rochester. It does feel like old times.  As your senator, I visited here probably more than 40 times, worked hand-in-hand with local leaders and businesses and schools to create jobs in clean energy and advanced manufacturing, connected farmers upstate with restaurants downstate, so people in Brooklyn and Queens could eat Red Jacket apples and drink Finger Lakes wine. It was a terrific adventure, and I appreciate Karen welcoming me home. New York took a chance on me back in 2000, and I'll never forget it.  And here today, I want to say from the outset that I'm with you. I will fight for you, I will stand up for you, and together we will do what we must to make sure public education [inaudible].  Like you, I think hard about the questions that we are facing. For example, how can we do better for the millions of children living in poverty in America? This is the first time I'm aware of, historically, that we've had a majority of poor children in our public schools.  How can we do better for the moms and dads working harder and harder every day just to get by?  How can we do better when the jobs of the future will require creativity and ingenuity and collaboration--yet our education system is increasingly focused on test preparation?  I know that our teachers and schools do amazing things for our kids every day. But I also know you can't do it alone. You need your country to have your backs, too.  If I'm fortunate enough to be your president starting January 20, 2017, I will have your backs. You can count on that.  I want every teacher, principal, parent and student to know you will have a partner in the White House. And that goes for everyone who helps our students succeed: teachers' aides, social workers, guidance counselors, school nurses, speech and occupational therapists, everyone who helps our students achieve all that they're capable of.  These issues are not new to me. When I got out of law school I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. I did it because I was inspired by the woman who started CDF, Marian Wright Edelman, and I did it because I wanted to use my legal education on behalf of kids. And I got off to a fast start: I was sent to Alabama to investigate segregated academies, to make the case against them getting tax-exempt status as they pulled people out of public schools, taking the resources and limiting the books, the shelves off the walls.  When my husband was governor of Arkansas, he asked me to chair a commission to improve education in our state. We obviously knew our schools were in bad shape. In fact one expert said Arkansas had perhaps the worst schools in the country. To me, that sounds like an emergency. So I went to work, had great support from people across the state, held hearings in every county. Thousands of people turned out. We discovered that many schools couldn't even offer the basics, like chemistry or foreign languages--forget about art or music.  So we worked to come up with a plan to get more schools the resources they needed. We fought hard to get it passed by the legislature. And a few years later, that same expert said that Arkansas had raised school standards dramatically, teachers had received desperately needed raises, and that we had done something which was hard to do--which is to change the attitude of a whole state toward the importance of education.  Now, the reason I am telling you this history is because the lesson was clear to me: We've got to come together and fight together to give our schools and teachers the resources you need to succeed. And we've got to convince the whole country once again to support public education.  Every child in this country deserves a world-class education, with good schools and effective, well-supported teachers--no matter what ZIP code they live in. Because when we invest in education, we're investing in our country's future, and in creating a stronger economy for all of us.  I have a plan for how we should strengthen public education. It comes from consultation with AFT and NEA. It boils down to TLC: teaching, learning and community.  I actually think our teachers and students could use a little TLC.  Tonight I want to focus on the "T"--teaching.  We've known for years that nothing in school matters more than an effective teacher. Now America is asking more of our educators than ever before.  You're asked to prepare our kids for a competitive economy, adapt your instruction to meet the diverse needs of your students, stay on top of new technologies and pedagogies, and adjust to a sea of reforms at the local, state and national levels.  We look to you to fill in gaps that we as a country have long neglected--like giving low-income kids, English-language learners, and kids with disabilities the support they need to thrive.  And we ask you to help make right everything from poverty and homelessness, to child health disparities, to the legacy of racial inequities stretching back centuries. These are major, complicated issues--and they should not be dumped on all you, yours alone to bear.  One of my main goals as president will be to launch a national campaign to modernize and elevate the profession of teaching. To reach out to encourage more talented young people to become teachers. To reach out and encourage more talented mid-career professionals to do the same.  As senator, I fought to pass legislation to recruit and train outstanding teachers, including veterans, because I believe there are many dedicated people out there who join your ranks to serve our students well and be good colleagues to you, if given the chance.  Recruiting and retaining effective teachers starts, however, with something very basic: raising teacher pay. I know I don't need to tell any of you, but teachers make nearly 15 percent less than other college graduates in America. That adds up to a lot of money over a career. So if we believe, as I do--and then we give lip service to--that teachers are professionals and that you do something valuable, we should pay you like we really believe it.  We should use other incentives, too--like student debt forgiveness. I supported this as your senator because I don't think it's right that our future educators are finishing college loaded down with debt.  That, combined with low pay, means too many teachers are taking second or even third jobs just to get by and support their families. It shouldn't be that hard to make it as a teacher. That's also why I supported a tax deduction for teachers who spend their own money on classroom supplies--which is pretty much every teacher I know.  And while we're at it--at a time when the majority of teachers are women, we need to stand up and fight for equal pay for women.  It's not just a woman's issue, although of course it is. This is a family issue. You have a mother, wife, sister, daughter, who are in the workforce--the last I checked, there was no discount for being a woman when you checked out at the supermarket. I don't think this happens, where a cashier looks and says, "Well, you're a white woman, so you only have to pay 77 cents to the dollar. Or you're an African American woman, you only have to pay 68 cents on the dollar. Or you're a Latina woman, you only have to pay 58 cents on the dollar."  There is no gender discount, and it's time that we start treating equal pay as [inaudible].  I also support raising the minimum wage nationwide, and I applaud the big step taken under Governor Cuomo's leadership to raise the minimum wage. Now, raising the minimum wage is a big deal in America. There's more work to be done, I grant you that. I can point to California and New York, which have just raised the minimum wage, and be able to say, "We are doing it, so let's do it for everybody."  Let's raise the minimum wage for everybody.  We also have to convince decision makers at every level to respect and help to raise your professional standing in the eyes of your fellow citizens.  You know the research and the comparisons and analysis--in countries like Finland and Singapore that score high in the international rankings, when you look behind the numbers what you find is this, it's so obvious: Their teachers are treated with respect as the professionals that they are. It's actually pretty obvious, isn't it? You treat somebody with respect, you give people the support they need to do this critical job, then you're going to see how the whole system's lifted up.  We've got to do a better job of preparing and supporting teachers. I want all teachers, at every stage of their careers, to know they'll be able to keep learning, keep improving, keep innovating. That goes for administrators, too. As senator, I worked with both UFT and NYSUT, along with AFT and NEA, to pass legislation to train and support not only teachers but principals, so that you have a whole-team concept that would make the difference for lots of students.  And supporting teachers means facing tough issues like over-testing. Many frustrated parents and teachers are saying enough is enough.  Tests should get back to their original purpose--to get information to teachers and parents so we can know how our kids are doing, and work together to help them improve. Let's keep working to find a fair, balanced approach to testing, so our kids learn what they need to compete in a global economy, and you have the tools to help them get there.  Everything that I'm talking about today is pretty straightforward, for those of you that are educators. But I know it can only be done in partnership with you.  So I am asking you to work with me, just as I have worked as your senator. I want your advice. I want your constructive criticism. I want to be held accountable. I want to support you in fighting for your students and your profession.  That goes for the "L" and "C" portions of TLC, too.  L is for learning. Let's build off what works. Let's go where the research and best practices point us.  You know, I have a dear friend who just retired from teaching. And I asked her one time, "What are the biggest differences from the time you started nearly 40 years ago to now that you're retired?" She made two great comments, I thought.  One, she said, "When I started, the children really understood that I was the authority figure. I would stand in front of the class, and, you know, there's the occasional kid that would misbehave, but in general kids were respectful, and understood what their role was and what mine was. Now," she said, "I feel like they all have remote control changers in their heads, and they're just constantly in motion, not really able to sit there and listen and respond in a way that used to just be taken for granted."  The other thing she said is, "It used to be that we would collaborate. Teachers at a school, teachers in the district, principals, all of the professionals, and we would work toward deciding what it is we would try to achieve. And we would very much rely on our own experience and also research to tell us what would work best." She said, "My last ten years of teaching, I just felt like the school district was prey for any fad that came along. [Inaudible].  I said, "Well, what did you do about that?" She said, "Well, I don't know. Maybe, if I'd been a lot younger, I would have really gotten more involved and fought back. What I really did was just lock my door to keep everybody out. [Inaudible], to keep my head clear to actually teach my students."  Now, I really wanted to repeat that to you because that made a lot of sense to me. The kids to some extent have changed, the environments from which they are coming have changed, the pressure on kids has increased--there's no way that I could even relate to some of the challenges that kids bring, both personally, because of their own situation, but more generally, because of living in the virtual world online. And I also respect her perspective that we've got to figure out how best to teach the kids we have, not the kids we used to have. How best to [inaudible].  Let's take what is working, put it to work in every classroom. I want every school district in America to offer programs in computer science and coding. But in order to do that, we have to set that goal. We have to be able to have a school that is wireable or has wireless to be able to do it. I have a lot of schools in New York that are 80, 100 years old, and that's a hard challenge to me. We have to do more to make sure we've got all of the resources--not just the teaching, but the equipment, and involve experts who should be part of the process.  We know that there will be created more than a million jobs in computer science over the next 10 years. I want young people in New York and across America to be able to compete for those jobs. That starts in our classrooms.  And you know better than any that learning begins at the very start of a child's life. This is a passion of mine. If we don't invest in early child education and universal pre-kindergarten, we are making more jobs harder and we are really [inaudible] a lot of our kids.  We're making some progress now in preschool and universal pre-k. I'm proud that in New York City we now have universal preschool. But this should be spread throughout the state--and it should be in every state. And every child should have the chance to develop his or her talents in those first five years of live. You know, 80 percent of your brain is physically formed by the age of three.  So we need to help preschoolers get pre-literacy and pre-math skills, so they can then be prepared for the work that starts in kindergarten and first, second, and third grade. Right now, in New York, low-income children come to kindergarten nearly a year behind in their language and math skills. That makes it harder to catch up. That's why we need to find programs that work. I started a statewide program back in Arkansas to teach parents how to be their children's first teachers. I convened the first ever White House Conference on Early Childhood Development when I was first lady.  And when I left the State Department, I launched a national campaign called "Too Small to Fail," to try to close the word gap and help children at every income level get a strong start on their language development. So we know that investing in preschool is not only good for individual kids' education, it's good for our economy.  And finally, we can't forget the "C" in TLC--community.  As important as teachers are--as important as the jobs you do happens to be--you need the support of the communities you serve. That comes down to all of us. There's been way too much finger-pointing and scapegoating in public education. And blaming teachers for everything you could imagine.  I believe the real problem is that communities, states, and our country aren't stepping up to work with you, to do everything they can to help every child succeed in school.  So we've made progress here in New York over the past 10 years. Students have improved in reading and math. We still have a ways to go, as you know, to get everybody up to proficiency in these subjects--but we're making progress.  And a big part of the reason why it's so challenging is because more students are living in poverty, more kids are coming from households that are struggling. More kids are facing really difficult situations at home--they're coming to school hungry, or after spending a night in a homeless shelter. They have the weight of the world on their little shoulders. And we need to do better. We can't just turn around and tell you to do better, we need to do better.  I do not believe that more testing will solve homelessness, or poverty, or [inaudible].  So we're going to do this together. We're going to tackle all these problems as one country--one American community. And I will be there with you every step of the way. I told both the AFT and the NEA during their endorsement process that I wanted them at every table where education was discussed.  [Inaudible] the front lines of education, information that I can only get from teachers and educators who are there. A lot of teachers tell me we should go back to the concept of community schools--bring in more non-profit organizations into the schools, make sure we have nurses in the schools, social workers in the schools.  Look, a lot of this is based on income inequality. You're from a well-off family, you get good mental health services, you have the chance to take piano lessons or join a soccer team or be in a play. Those experiences have been stripped out of the budgets of so many schools, and those were often the way where kids find themselves, learning [inaudible].  So we've got a lot to talk about. But I just want to mention, briefly, that there are real differences among those of us who are running. And it's important to really follow it. Lots of folks don't even talk about education. In fact, I'm not even sure, in all the debates we've had, I've been asked one question about public education. I may be wrong about that, but I don't think I have.  And what I want you to focus on--and tell your friends, your neighbors--is that we have a political fight on our hands. There's no doubt in my mind that any of the Republicans would be a disaster for public education.  Ted Cruz says he wants to abolish the Department of Education. Donald Trump says he'd largely eliminate it, but maybe he'd leave some "tentacles out there," whatever that means. They want to slash and burn the public education infrastructure that millions of families rely on. And they not only want to undermine--they want to destroy unions.  I wish I could say that was unusual or unique to them, but that is the current Republican party's priority. That's why they attack teachers at every turn. You've got to remember, before he dropped out, Chris Christie was so proud of the fact that he [inaudible].  What I really, really resent about this is not only that it hurts you and your colleagues--it's that it hurts our kids. That sends a message, going back to my friend's story, that people in positions of power and influence don't respect teachers. So how do we expect kids to respect teachers?  Here's the bottom line--you know it, I know it: Our students deserve better. We've got to invest in our teachers if we're going to give our kids a world-class education.  I am the product of great public schools--and great teachers. I think about them all the time. In first grade, Miss Taylor read us all Winnie the Pooh. In fifth grade, Mrs. Krause taught us about Sputnik, and literally convinced us that President Eisenhower was watching to see if we did math and science. In sixth grade, Miss King drilled us in grammar--she had all of these poems that she used to use to tell us about nouns and verbs. I still remember them.  And in high school, my teachers challenged me. They really pushed me hard. They helped me understand the world I lived in and what I might be able to do to make a difference.  That's what my teachers did, and that's what you do--spark a student's love for learning and change the course of his or her life.  I want all our kids to have those experiences and opportunities--no matter where they live or how they start out.  My little granddaughter will be starting preschool in the not-too-distant future. I hope she loves school like her mom and I did. I want that for every little girl and boy in America. I know you do too.  So, let's be resolved that we're going to change the politics and the attitudes of people in this country--at all levels--towards teaching and towards education. We're going to work for better schools, more resources, more support for educators. I will be the president who helps you get that support. I will make that promise, that [inaudible], we will reconfigure federal spending so that those reflect the promises, made years ago, they intended for.  Title I was to help equalize spending, so that we must lift up the poorest schools and the poorest children. In the 1970s, I worked with the Children's Defense Fund to gather the evidence to make it possible to pass a law that gave kids with disabilities the chance to win the lottery, in their eyes, because they would get to go to school--something they were not able to do before.  But we made a promise--that the federal government would pay 40 percent of special education--the most we've ever paid is 17 percent. Which is one of the reasons why budgets are being cut all the time, and many programs are being [inaudible].  Because--I know you've got work to do tonight, but I love talking to you tonight about all of this--because I am so convinced we're going to make a big difference together. I can't do it without you. I need your help in the NY primary on April 19. If all goes well and I'm the nominee, no matter who the Republicans nominate, I'm really looking forward to debating either Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.  Mr. Trump, tell me again about how you're going to build this wall and make the Mexicans pay for it. Tell me again why you think it's a good idea for Japan and South Korea to develop nuclear weapons. I mean, it's going to be good.  But I want you to just leave with this thought: I will get up every day trying to think about what I can do that day to get every child in this country the chance ... I believe that that's how we'll make sure all of our kids get the chance to make the most of their God-given potential. And I cannot even imagine how I would go about doing that without having you as my partners--without working with you, without supporting you, without making the changes that we know are needed for some "TLC".  So, as I leave you tonight, please know that I am convinced--I am confident--that together we will not only save public education, but we will improve it, and the entire country will have to see it for themselves. Thank you all very much. Well, thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you and please, please be seated.  I am delighted to be back at this beautiful school, in this wonderful city and to have a chance to talk with all of you. I want to recognize former Governor Doyle. Thank you so much for being here.  Somebody asked me, "So, why are you going to Madison?"  I said, "Why wouldn't I? I love going to Madison. I've been to Madison quite a few times."  "Well, I mean, it's a place where your opponent is very competitive."  I said, "Yeah that's true, but I'm here because, not only do I want to compete for every vote, I respect the people of Madison and Dane County."  I want a chance to talk with you and I want you to know where I am coming from with respect to one of the most important issues facing our country. As someone who's been fighting for progressive causes her whole life. I think it's important that we take a broad view about what's at stake in this election.  I've been making the case in this campaign that we're not a single-issue country. Our next president has to be able to break down all the barriers that are holding us back, not just some of them.  And there are so many challenges we need to take on that don't always get the attention they deserve on the campaign trail.  So today I'm going to talk about one of those challenges--something that matters a great deal to our future, to your future, the future of our country, and that is the Supreme Court.  Stop and think about it--and how many law students are here? Do we have some? Law students are here, so you think about this.  But if you do stop and think this, the court shapes virtually every aspect of life in the United States--from whether you can marry the person you love, to whether you can get healthcare, to whether your classmates can carry guns around this campus.  A lot of Americans are concerned about money in politics, and rightly so. It's a serious problem that we have to address.  But Supreme Court justices are appointed for life. They're not making decisions based on campaign contributions; they're making them based on legal philosophy--and in some cases, ideology.  And for a long time now, the ideological bent of the court has led our country in the wrong direction, especially when it comes to stacking the deck in favor of the already wealthy and powerful.  If we're serious about fighting for progressive causes, we need to focus on the court: who sits on it, how we choose them, and how much we let politics--partisan politics--dominate that process.  And I can't think of a better place for this discussion than right here in Madison, because these decisions will affect you.  Before I was a senator from New York or a secretary of state, and even before I was a wife or mother, for that matter--I was a lawyer.  I was drawn to the law for the same reason a lot of young people are: I put my faith in justice and fairness. And I saw the profound impact that our justice system has on people's lives, for better or for worse. And I wanted to help make it for the better.  So when I was in law school I volunteered for the New Haven legal aid association. After I graduated, I put my legal education to work at the Children's Defense Fund. I ran the legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas Law School where I taught, supervising students providing legal assistance to prison inmates and poor families.  And when President Carter appointed me to the Legal Services Corporation, which is the largest single provider of civil legal aid in America, it was one of the greatest honors of my life.  And we fought hard to convince Congress that using the law to help poor families was a just and necessary cause. And we won that fight. We hired an army of lawyers to work on behalf of more than a million poor clients across the country--helping families avoid eviction, fight discrimination, receive their earned federal benefits, and so much more.  But I also learned, when the administration changed, and President Carter went out, and President Reagan went in, that you couldn't ever rest in the fight for justice and fairness. And we kept fighting. And thankfully we had increased legal services before that time because it's been pretty much static ever since.  Because of these experiences, I come to the issue of the Supreme Court not just as a former senator who took my constitutional responsibility to "advise and consent" seriously, but also as a lawyer who spent years fighting for people who weren't getting a fair deal in our system.  And I carry all these experiences with me--all those clients and all those cases--every single day.  So today, I want to share some of my thoughts on the Supreme Court, and then I would love to hear from you.  We start with that basic premise that I already stated: The court matters.  At its best, the court is a place where the least powerful voices in our society are heard and protected--whether they be African Americans trying to vote or people getting an education in the era of segregated schools and poll taxes, or women trying to make our own health decisions in the face of humiliating laws that would strip that right away.  Now this may be hard for you today in 2016 to really believe, but I was in high school. The Supreme Court decided a case called Griswold v. Connecticut. That case recognized that women have the right to make the personal choice of whether to use birth control. Before that in some places in our country like Connecticut, it could be a criminal offense.  So that case left a powerful impression on me. Along with all the civil rights cases from the 1950s forward, I saw the court as a place where wrongs were righted, and where everyday folks could stand on equal footing with the most powerful people in the land.  In recent years, the court has made a lot of high-profile decisions--some that uphold this progressive tradition, and some that tarnish it. It effectively declared George W. Bush president. It cut the heart out of the Voting Rights Act. It overturned commonsense laws addressing gun violence, and said that certain employers get to decide whether their female workers can access free birth control under the Affordable Care Act.  But it also made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, preserved the Affordable Care Act--not once, but twice--and ensured equal access to education for women.  The death of Justice Scalia marked the end of an era.  Now as you know, there's a fight over whether President Obama should nominate a replacement, as the Constitution requires. And that fight is revealing the worst of our politics--the same obstructionism that we've seen from Republicans since the beginning of the Obama Administration, the same disregard for the rule of the law that's given rise to the extremist candidacies of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.  It's corroding our democracy, and it has to stop.  For those of you who aren't following the saga, the story is pretty straightforward: President Obama has done his job and nominated Merrick Garland, one of the most respected judges in the country, to become the ninth justice. Democrats admire him. Republicans do, too. In fact, a few years ago, when another seat was open on the court, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah--who's not exactly a liberal--said that if the president named Judge Garland, there was "no question" that he'd be confirmed. In fact Senator Hatch called the judge a "consensus nominee."  Now normally, this is when the Senate would do its job--hold hearings, consider the nomination, call for a vote.  But Republicans say they won't. They won't even hold a hearing. It doesn't matter how qualified the president's nominee is, or what the Constitution says, or what our country needs.  This is their job! But they refuse to do it.  Senator Chuck Grassley, the head of the judiciary committee, could hold a hearing tomorrow if he wanted. But he says we should wait for a new president because, and I quote, "the American people shouldn't be denied a voice."  Well, as one of the more than 65 million Americans who voted to re-elect Barack Obama, I'd say my voice is being ignored right now because of their obstructionism.  We chose a president. We chose him twice. And now Republicans in the Senate are acting like our votes didn't count, and that President Obama is not still our nation's leader. And I'll tell you, those are not high-minded principles--they are low-minded politics.  And today, I'm adding my voice to the chorus asking Senator Grassley to step up and do his job. He should hold a hearing--and he should schedule it as soon as the Senate returns from recess.  But let's keep in mind--this battle is bigger than just one empty seat on the court.  By Election Day, two justices will be more than 80 years old--past the court's average retirement age. The next president could end up nominating multiple justices.  That means whoever America elects this fall will help determine the future of the court for decades to come.  Just look at the court's docket, the cases that it's hearing this term alone.  The court is reviewing how public sector unions collect the fees they use to do their work. The economic security of millions of teachers, social workers and first responders is at stake. This is something the people of Wisconsin know all too well, because your governor has repeatedly attacked and bullied public sector unions, and working families have paid the price. I think that's wrong, and it should stop.  The court is reviewing a Texas law imposing unnecessary, expensive requirements on doctors who perform abortions. If that law is allowed to stand, there will only be 10 or so health centers left where women can get safe, legal abortions in the whole state of Texas, a state with about 5.4 million women of reproductive age. So it will effectively end the legal right to choose for millions of women.  The court is also reviewing whether Texas should have to exclude non-voters when drawing its electoral map. That would leave out, among others, legal residents, people with felony convictions and children. The fair representation of everyone in our society--including 75 million children--hangs in the balance.  And on top of all that, the court is reviewing affirmative action and President Obama's executive actions on immigration, which called for halting the deportation of DREAMers and undocumented parents of citizens and legal residents. It's also put a hold on the president's clean-power plan. Either America can limit how much carbon pollution we produce, or we can't. And if we can't, then our ability to work with other nations to meet the threat of climate change under the Paris agreement is greatly diminished.  In short: In a single term, the Supreme Court could demolish pillars of the progressive movement. And as someone who has worked on every single one of these issues for decades, I see this as a make-or-break moment.  If you care about the fairness of elections, the future of unions, racial disparities in universities, the rights of women, or the future of our planet, you should care about who wins the presidency and appoints the next Supreme Court justices.  And consider, if you will, the dangerous turn the court has taken in recent years toward protecting the rights of corporations over those of people.  Now you may have heard of the case Citizens United. The court ruled that corporations have an unfettered right to free speech, just like you and me. That means no limit on what corporations can spend independently to influence elections. And--big surprise--a flood of money from rich people, corporations and special interests has poured into our politics.  Citizens United opened the door to the creation of super PACs and between the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, spending by outside groups tripled. In 2014, the top 100 donors to super PACs spent nearly as much as all 4.75 million small donors in the country combined.  Now the idea, I believe, that money is speech turns our Constitution upside down. Wealth should not be privileged in the courts--in fact, it should have no privilege. Yet at a time when inequality between working Americans and those at the top is starker than ever, the Supreme Court has given the wealthiest Americans even greater power to affect what happens in our democracy.  Justice Ginsburg says if there were one recent decision she'd overrule, it's this one. I'm with her. And I hope she gets the chance to do just that.  Now people forget this, but the Citizens United case actually began with yet another a right-wing attack on me. It grew out of a Wisconsin case about whether corporations can run issue ads, so-called "issue ads," close to an election. So we all have a personal stake in this.  If the court doesn't overturn Citizens United, I will fight for a constitutional amendment to limit the influence of money in elections. It is dangerous to our country and poisonous to our politics.  But it doesn't stop with Citizens United. This court has voted on the side of corporations--against the interests of workers, unions, consumers and the general public--in case after case.  It's made it harder for consumers to band together to sue a corporation, even if they are collectively suffering from corporate behavior. So 2 million Comcast subscribers in Philadelphia were told they each had to hire a lawyer if they wanted to sue for fairer prices. One-and-a-half million women working at Walmart each had to hire a lawyer if they wanted to sue for sex discrimination. That's a burden that the vast majority of people cannot afford.  I know this might sound a little technical, but it points to an alarming trend.  The court used to--in the 20th century anyway--protect the little guy against the rich and powerful. More and more, it's doing the opposite--protecting the rich and powerful against the little guy.  One study found that between 2009 and 2012, the one party most likely to convince the court to hear a case, out of all the top petitioners, from every part of our society and economy, was the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. So the court was more likely to take up cases concerning corporate interests and then to decide in favor of those corporate interests.  If I'm fortunate enough to be president, I will appoint justices who will make sure the scales of justice are not tipped away from individuals toward corporations and special interests; who will protect the constitutional principles of liberty and equality for all, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or political viewpoint; who will protect a woman's right to choose, rather than billionaires' right to buy elections; and who will see the Constitution as a blueprint for progress, not a barrier to it.  So I hope you and everyone across Wisconsin, everyone across America, keeps the court in mind when you vote.  Now, some of you may already have decided to support me, some of you may have decided differently--I will keep working to earn your vote. But even if you are decided or undecided, I will be for you. But I ask you this: Please make sure the court factors into your decision.  Conservatives know exactly how high the stakes are. For years, they have used aggressive legal strategies to accomplish through the courts what they've failed to accomplish through legislation. They couldn't pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, so they tried to get the courts to do it. They couldn't stop the president's Clean Power Plan, and they couldn't pass immigration reform, and they didn't want the president to act, so they got the courts to step in.  Now they are fighting hard to make sure the Supreme Court includes as many right-wing justices as possible.  As scary as it might be, ask yourselves: What kind of justice will a President Trump appoint? Or for that matter, what kind of attorney general? What kind of lower court judges?  And as you know, he believes Muslims should be banned from entering this country because of their faith. What would that mean for a nation founded on religious freedom?  He wants to round up 11 million immigrants and kick them out. What would that mean for a nation built by immigrants?  He says wages for working people are too high and we shouldn't raise the minimum wage. What would that mean for working people, and a court that's already tilting in favor of powerful corporations?  Let's be clear about what's really going on here. The current fight over Judge Garland is just the latest in a long line of actions aimed at disrupting our government and undermining our president. And the result is an America that's more divided, more dysfunctional, and less secure.  Consider how Republicans, led by Ted Cruz, shut down the entire federal government in 2013, rather than fund the Affordable Care Act. Or how they almost shut down the government again last fall over trying to defund Planned Parenthood.  Remember what Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said back in 2010--that the single most important priority for Republicans was making Barack Obama a one-term president. Now some people thought that was hyperbole. But I always remember Maya Angelou's advice: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them." Right?  And today, Republican leaders have been showing us who they are, in fact, for a long time. Blocking Judge Garland is just the latest evidence and we should start believing them.  If you want to know where that kind of obstruction and recklessness leads, just look at the Republican race for the presidency.  Now every day, another Republican bemoans the rise of Donald Trump. They say a Trump nomination will set their party back decades. I agree. It will set the Republican Party back if Donald Trump is their standard-bearer.  But Donald Trump didn't come out of nowhere. What the Republicans have sown with their extremist tactics, they are now reaping with Donald Trump's candidacy.  It wasn't long after Senator McConnell said his number-one goal was to prevent the president's reelection that Donald Trump started his racist campaign to discredit the president's citizenship--remember the birther movement? And Ted Cruz embarked on his strategy of holding the government hostage to get his way.  These things are connected.  When you have leaders willing to bring the whole of government to a halt to make headlines, you may just give rise to candidates who promise to do even more radical and dangerous things--because once you make the extreme normal, you open the door to even worse.  And when you have a party dead-set on demonizing the president, you may just end up with a candidate who says the president never legally was the president at all.  Enough is enough. It's time for us to take a stand--and you can start right here in Wisconsin.  Your senator, Ron Johnson, is bragging about blocking the president. He's in a tight race against former Senator Russ Feingold, an exceptional public servant. During his time on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Feingold actually helped build a stronger judiciary.  So when you leave here, I urge you to call the office of Senator Johnson, email him, contact him--if he has a Facebook page, go on and express your opinion. Tell him to stop playing games with the Supreme Court.  And remember this, remember this in November, when you choose who stands for you in the Senate: The incumbent will vote for corporations and against working people. His opponent will vote for a court that will listen to you.  Then keep these larger issues in mind when you go to the polls on April 5.  It's time to get back to what makes America already great--respect for the rule of law, statesmanship over showmanship, and people working together across party lines for the good of the nation.  That's what this court fight is really about. That's what this election is about--whether we, as a country, are able to come together to meet the challenges we face and break down all the barriers holding people back; or whether we will be paralyzed by deadlock and divided from each other by bitter partisanship.  At our best, America has united behind the ideal that everyone deserves a fair shot, no matter who we are or where we started out. And at its best, the Supreme Court has defended that ideal.  Like in 1954, when the court abolished segregation in our schools.  Or 1973, when it ruled that women have the right to make intimate health decisions for ourselves.  Or 1977, when the court paved the way for public sector unions.  Or 1982, when it ruled that undocumented children had the right to go to school.  Or just last year, when the court ruled that marriage equality was the law of the land.  You know, all Jim Obergefell wanted was to marry his partner of more than 20 years, John Arthur, before John Arthur died of ALS. They ended up flying to Maryland, because their home state of Ohio didn't recognize same-sex marriage. John was so sick, he couldn't even leave the plane--but they got married right there on the tarmac in Baltimore, then flew straight home.  And when John died three months later, Ohio listed him as single on his death certificate. For the partner who had loved and cared for him, this was a bitter, painful blow, a rejection of the life they had built together over decades--until the Supreme Court ruled that Jim and John's marriage was legal everywhere in the United States of America.  And in that decision, Justice Kennedy wrote, "The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all its dimensions. So they entrusted to future generations a charge protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning."  That decision is the latest reminder of what the court can do when it stand for equality, or against it. When it can make America a fairer place, or roll back the progress we've worked so hard to achieve.  It depends on what the court decides, and it depends on who's deciding.  Which, in the end, means it depends on all of us.  So think hard about the court. For years people have tried to make the court a voting issues, and it's not easy to do.  People are rightly concerned about their economic well-being, about the education of their children, about their health care, about their social security payment. About all the other issues that keep people up at night around millions of kitchen tables.  But this election has ripped away the curtain and made it absolutely clear to everyone how essential the Supreme Court is to those decisions as well. I will keep talking about it, and advocating, and calling on the Senate to do its job, and I hope there will be a great chorus of voices across our land that will do the same.  It's our Constitution, it's our court, and it's our future.  Thank you all very much. Wow! Thank you so very much. I cannot tell you how personally honored I am to be here with all of you, to be at this historic institution. Let me start by thanking President Rudley, everyone at Texas Southern university. It's a great treat to be here, to have heard just briefly from Dr. Rudley and others about the incredible programs and progress and the fact that you graduated more than 1,000 young people into the world not so many days ago. This institution is the living legacy, the absolute embodiment of Heman Marion Sweatt and the long struggle for civil rights. and for me, to be surrounded by so many here in Houston, Texas, and indeed from across our country, who were part of that movement is especially touching. I am delighted to be here with my friend, Sheila Jackson Lee, she has been a tireless champion for the people of the 18th District and state and the country.  I have to tell you though I thought she would tell you about the most important news coming out of Congress. And that is she is finally a member of the grandmother's club. And as a member of now a little over eight months, it is the best club you will ever be a member of, Sheila. I have to tell you I was excited to come here and to talk about an issue that is important to Barbara Jordan and should be important to all of us. But to do so in front of Dr. Freeman is a little daunting. I mean anyone who knows what this man has meant, not only to Barbara Jordan but to so many who have studied here who have been in anyway effected by his brilliant teaching, elocution and delivery would be a little daunted too. I noticed that both Dr. Rudley and Dr. Sheila both got off before Dr. Freeman came up.  I also want to say my thoughts and prayers are with all the families in Houston and across Texas affected by the recent terrible flooding. And I am confident that this community will embrace them. I remember very well coming here after Katrina with my husband, and in fact we decided to invite along a young Senator from Illinois by the name of Barack Obama, along and with Sheila and other leaders in the community. We toured the facilities that Houston had provided to those who were fleeing that horrific storm. And I saw how people had opened their hearts and their homes. This is a city that knows how to pull together, and I'm confident you'll do so again on behalf of those who are suffering from this latest terrible disaster.  And it is also a special moment to be here, knowing that Barbara Jordan was succeeded by Mickey Leland and the 18th District was so well represented for so long, and I am delighted to be here with Alison and to remember the pioneering work he did on behalf of children and the poor and hungry. So many issues that he was the champion of. And I want to thank Rosemary McGowan and all the friends and loved ones of Barbara Jordan here today. This is such a particular honor for me because the award is in memory of one of my true personal heroes--a woman who taught me and so many others the meaning of courage and determination in the pursuit of justice.  I first met Barbara Jordan when I was a young attorney and had been given a position working for the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee investigating Richard Nixon, and it was such a profound moment in American history. And there wasn't anyone who was a more effective eloquent inquisitor than Barbara Jordan.  As a 26-year-old fresh out of law school, as some of you are perhaps now having graduated from the Thurgood Marshall School here at TSU, I was riveted and not a little intimidated to tell you the truth by this unstoppable Congresswoman from Texas. I got to talk with her, which was thrilling, I got to hand her papers, which was equally exciting, but mostly I got to watch and listen to her.  At a time of shaken confidence, she stirred the entire nation with her words.  Remember what she said: "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete; it is total."  It was that passion and moral clarity that took Barbara Jordan from the TSU and the halls of Texas legislature all the ways to the halls of Congress. The first woman and the first African American ever elected to represent Texas in the House of Representatives.  And she defended and continued the civil rights legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and her friend and mentor President Lyndon Johnson--and in particular she was a staunch advocate for the Voting Rights Act, which had helped make it possible for her to be elected.  In 1975, in the face of fierce opposition, Barbara Jordan led the fight to extend the special protections of the Voting Rights Act to many more Americans, including Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans as well.  And like every woman who has run for national office in this country in the last four decades, I stand here on the shoulders of Barbara Jordan and so does our entire country.  And boy do we miss her. We miss her courage, we also miss her humor, she was funny and most of all her irresistible voice.  I remember talking to her and Ann Richards one time. And between the two of them, forget trying to get a word in at all. And they were telling me about how they would love to go to the University of Texas women's basketball games. Right, and Barbara would be there by that time in her wheelchair, and Ann would be holding court right next to her. And Barbara would be yelling directions like she was, you know, the coach. "Why are you doing that? Jump higher! That's not a pass!" You know, all of those kinds of sideline comments. And so Ann was telling me this, with Barbara right there and I finally turned to her and said, "Barbara, encourage these young women, don't just criticize them." And Barbara turned around and said, "When they deserve it, I will." We sure could use her irresistible voice. I wish we could hear that voice one more time.  Hear her express the outrage we feel about the fact that 40 years after Barbara Jordan fought to extend the Voting Rights Act, its heart has been ripped out.  And I wish we could hear her speak up for the student who has to wait for hours for his or her right to vote. For the grandmother who's turned away from the polls because her driver's license expired. For the father who's done his time and paid his debt to society but still hasn't gotten his rights back.  Now we know, unfortunately, Barbara isn't here to speak up for them and so many others. But we are. And we have a responsibility to say clearly and directly what's really going on in our country--because what is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other.  Because since the Supreme Court eviscerated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote.  North Carolina passed a bill that went after pretty much anything that makes voting more convenient or more accessible. Early voting. Same-day registration. The ability of county election officials to even extend voting hours to accommodate long lines.  Now what possible reason could there be to end pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-olds and eliminate voter outreach in high schools?  We should be doing everything we can to get our young people more engaged in democracy, not less.  In fact I would say it is a cruel irony--but no coincidence--that Millennials, the most diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in American history, are now facing so much exclusion.  And we need look no further than right here in Texas. You all know this far better than I, but if you want to vote in this state, you can use a concealed weapon permit as a valid form of identification--but a valid student ID isn't good enough?  Now, Krystal Watson found out the hard way. She grew up in Louisiana but came to Marshall, Texas, to attend Wiley College. Krystal takes her responsibilities as a citizen so seriously that not only did she register to vote in Texas, where she was living and would be for a number of years, she even became a deputy registrar to help other people vote as well. But this past year, when she showed up at her local polling place with a Wiley College ID, she was turned away.  Experts estimate that hundreds of thousands of registered voters in Texas may face similar situations.  And while high-profile state laws like those in Texas and North Carolina get most of the attention, many of the worst offenses against the right to vote actually happen below the radar. Like when authorities shift poll locations and election dates. Or scrap language assistance for non-English speakers--something Barbara Jordan fought so hard for.  Without the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, no one outside the local community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge them and end them.  It's not a surprise for you to hear that studies and everyday experiences confirm that minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at the polls. They are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting machines.  In South Carolina, for example, there's supposed to be one machine for every 250 voters. But in minority areas, that rule is just often overlooked. In Richland Country, nearly 90 percent of the precincts failed to meet the standard required by law in 2012. Instead of 250 voters per machine, in one precinct it was more than 430 voters per machine. Not surprisingly, people trying to cast a ballot there faced massive delays.  Now there are many fair-minded, well-intentioned election officials and state legislators all over this country. But this kind of disparity that I just mentioned does not happen by accident.  Now some of you may have heard me or my husband say one of our favorite sayings from Arkansas, of course I learned it from him. "You find a turtle on a fence post, it did not get there on its own." Well, all of these problems with voting did not just happen by accident. And it is just wrong, it's wrong to try to prevent, undermine, inhibit Americans' rights to vote. Its counter to the values we share. And at a time when so many Americans have lost trust in our political system, it's the opposite of what we should be doing in our country.  This is the greatest, longest-lasting democracy in the history of the world. We should be clearing the way for more people to vote, not putting up every roadblock anyone can imagine.  Yet unfortunately today, there are people who offer themselves to be leaders whose actions have undercut this fundamental American principle.  Here in Texas, former Governor Rick Perry signed a law that a federal court said was actually written with the purpose of discriminating against minority voters. He applauded when the Voting Rights Act was gutted, and said the lost protections were "outdated and unnecessary."  But Governor Perry is hardly alone in his crusade against voting rights.  In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker cut back early voting and signed legislation that would make it harder for college students to vote.  In New Jersey, Governor Christie vetoed legislation to extend early voting.  And in Florida, when Jeb Bush was governor, state authorities conducted a deeply flawed purge of voters before the presidential election in 2000.  Thankfully in 2004 a plan to purge even more voters was headed off.  So today, Republicans are systematically and deliberately trying to stop millions of American citizens from voting. What part of democracy are they afraid of?  I believe every citizen has the right to vote. And I believe we should do everything we can to make it easier for every citizen to vote.  I call on Republicans at all levels of government with all manner of ambition to stop fear mongering about a phantom epidemic of election fraud and start explaining why they're so scared of letting citizens have their say.  Yes, this is about democracy. But it's also about dignity. About the ability to stand up and say, yes, I am a citizen. I am an American. My voice counts. And no matter where you come from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. In fact, it means a lot.  I learned those lessons right here in Texas, registering voters in south Texas down in the valley in 1972.  Some of the people I met were, understandably, a little wary of a girl from Chicago who didn't speak a word of Spanish. But they wanted to vote. They were citizens. They knew they had a right to be heard. They wanted to exercise all the rights and responsibilities that citizenship conveys. That's what should matter because when those rights are denied to anyone, we're all the worse for it. It doesn't just hold back the aspirations of individual citizens. It holds back our entire country.  That's why, as a Senator, I championed a bill called the Count Every Vote Act. If it had become law, it would have made Election Day a federal holiday and mandated early voting opportunities. Deceiving voters, including by sending flyers into minority neighborhoods with false voting times and places, would have become a federal crime. And many Americans with criminal convictions who had paid their debts to society would have finally gotten their voting rights back.  Well today, with the damage to the Voting Rights Act so severe, the need for action is even more urgent.  First, Congress should move quickly to pass legislation to repair that damage and restore the full protections that American voters need and deserve.  I was in the Senate in 2006 when we voted 98 to zero to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act after an exhaustive review process.  There had been more than 20 hearings in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Testimony from expert witnesses. Investigative reports documenting continuing discrimination in covered jurisdictions. There were more than 15,000 pages of legislative record. Now that is how the system is supposed to work. You gather the evidence, you weigh it and you decide. And we did 98 to nothing. We put principle ahead of politics. That is what Congress needs to do again.  Second, we should implement the recommendations of the bipartisan presidential commission to improve voting. That commission was chaired by President Obama's campaign lawyer and by Governor Mitt Romney campaign's lawyer. And they actually agreed. And they set forth common sense reforms, including expanding early, absentee, and mail voting. Providing online voter registration. Establishing the principle that no one should ever have to wait more than 30 minutes to cast your vote.  Third, we should set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting everywhere--including opportunities for weekend and evening voting. If families coming out of church on Sunday before an election are inspired to go vote, they should be free to do just that. And we know that early in-person voting will reduce those long lines and give more citizens the chance to participate, especially those who have work or family obligations that make it difficult to get to the polls on Election Day.  It's not just convenient--it's also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable than absentee voting. So let's get this done.  And I believe we should go even further to strengthen voting rights in America. So today I am calling for universal, automatic voter registration. Every citizen, every state in the Union. Everyone, every young man or young woman should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18--unless they actively choose to opt out. But I believe this would have a profound impact on our elections and our democracy. Between a quarter and a third of all eligible Americans remain unregistered and therefore unable to vote.  And we should modernize our entire approach to registration. The current system is a relic from an earlier age. It relies on a blizzard of paper records and it's full of errors.  We can do better. We can make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and complete. When you move, your registration should move with you. If you are an eligible vote and want to be registered, you should be a registered voter--period.  Now, Oregon is already leading the way modernizing its system, and the rest of the country should follow. The technology is there. States have a lot of the data already. It's just a matter of syncing and streamlining.  Now, all of these reforms, from expanded early voting to modernized registration, are common sense ways to strengthen our democracy. But I'll be candid here, none of them will come easily.  It's going to take leadership at many levels.  Now more than ever, we need our citizens to actually get out and vote for people who want to hear what is on their minds.  We need more activists working to expose abuses, educate Americans about their rights, and hold authorities accountable for protecting them. Some of the worst provisions in recent laws have been blocked or delayed by tireless advocates raising the alarm and filing legal challenges. But they can't do it alone.  We need more grassroots mobilization efforts like the Moral Monday movement in North Carolina to build momentum for reform.  We need more Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen's right to vote, I mean the principle underlying our Constitution, which we had to fight for a long time to make apply to everybody, one person, one vote and we need a Supreme Court that cares more about protecting the right to vote of a person than the right to buy and election of a corporation.  But of course, you know what we really need? We need more elected leaders from Houston to Austin to Washington who will follow in the footsteps of Barbara Jordan and fight for the rights and opportunities of everyday Americans, not just those at the top of the ladder. And we need to remember that progress is built on common ground, not scorched earth.  You know, when I traveled around the world as your Secretary of State, one of the most frequent questions I was asked was, "How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard in that campaign?"  People were genuinely amazed, which I suppose is understandable, considering that in many places, when you lose an election or you oppose someone who wins you could get imprisoned or exiled--even killed--not hired as Secretary of State.  And it's true, I was surprised when the President asked me to serve. But he made that offer, and I accepted it, because we both love our country.  So my friends, here at this historic institution let us remember that America was built by people who knew that our common interest was more important than our self-interest. They were fearless in pursuit of a stronger, freer, and fairer nation.  As Barbara Jordan famously reminded us, when the Constitution was first written, it left most of us here out. But generations of Americans fought and marched and organized and prayed to expand the circle of freedom and opportunity. They never gave up and never backed down.  And nearly a century ago on this very day, after years of struggle, Congress finally passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to vote in the United States.  So that is, that is the story of progress, courageous men and women, expanding rights, not restricting them. And today we refuse, we refuse to allow our country or this generation of leaders to slow or reverse America's long march toward a more perfect union.  We owe it to our children and grandchildren to fight just as hard as those who came before us did. To march just as far. To organize just as well. To speak out just as loudly. And to vote, every chance we get for the kind of future we want.  That's what Barbara Jordan would do. That's what we should do in honor of her.  Thank you, and may God bless you. It is wonderful to be back in Nevada and at Rancho. I am delighted to be joined by a number of young people who are going to talk with me, and all of you, about their lives and their stories, particularly immigration. I want to acknowledge my friend and Congresswoman Dina Titus for being here, thank you. And it is Cinco De Mayo, so it's an especially appropriate day to be having this conversation.  I want to begin by thanking everyone at Rancho High School for hosting us today. I am looking forward to hearing from each of our panel participants. I have wonderful memories from my time here in Nevada. I have gone door to door meeting with families not far from this school. I've met with a lot of culinary workers and other workers who keep the economy going strong. I accompanied a registered nurse on her 12-hour shift at St. Rose Dominican Hospital and then was very pleased to go back to her home and have dinner with her kids.  I know how hard hit Nevadans were by the Great Recession. This state in particular suffered some very tough blows. There was a much higher than average foreclosure rate, for example. A lot of people lost their jobs or their hours were cut dramatically, which made it more difficult for them to continue to make a good living.  We now see that this state is coming back from these tough economic times. Families have found a lot of different ways to make it work for them. We also saw people once again starting businesses, thinking about sending their kids to college, maybe doing some of those home repairs, maybe putting a little aside for retirement. But we're not yet back on our feet.  We have certainly climbed out of the hole we were in, but now we have to do more than get by, we have to get ahead and stay ahead. And there are a lot of ways that we have to think about how we do that together. I think that it's important to recognize that even with all the hard work and sacrifice that so many families made. In many ways, the deck is still stacked for those at the top. And I'm well aware that in Las Vegas, there's nothing worse than a stacked deck. I want to reshuffle the deck.  I want to be a champion for hardworking Americans, I want to work across party lines, I want to work with the public and private sector, I want people to get back to the good old-fashioned American style of problem solving and setting us back on the right course.  Now to help reshuffle the deck, people have to do their part, they have to step up and take education seriously, they have to be willing to work hard.  My father was a small-business man, and when I say that, he was a really small-business man. A couple day workers, my mom, my brothers, and I. But he understood that hard work was the way forward in the United States, and he made a good living, and I will forever be grateful for that.  Because when families are strong, America is strong, and I am convinced having fought for families going all the way back to my days in law school and ever since, there is nothing is more important.  Now in this campaign I think we have to wage and win four big fights. One is to build the economy of tomorrow, and not yesterday, and that means we have to be really focused on what is going to help prepare young people, and we have to start early. Education is the key, but education in the first years of life is essential because now we know that brain development has formed really by the time a child is three or four.  So we have to do more to make sure that every single child has the best chance to do well in school, to get ahead, to chart his or her own future, to live up to his or her own God-given potential. It is also essential that we strengthen families and communities and that means that we have to finally and once and for all fix our immigration system--this is a family issue, its an economic issue too, but it is at heart a family issue. If we claim we are for family, then we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system.  The American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because it's the right thing to do--and it is--but because it will strengthen families, strengthen our economy, and strengthen our country. That's why we can't wait any longer, we can't wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.  Now, this is where I differ with everybody on the Republican side. Make no mistake: Today not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one. When they talk about "legal status," that's code for "second-class status."  And we should never forget that this debate is about people who, and you're going to meet some of them in a second, people who work hard, who love this country, who pay taxes to it and want nothing more than to build better lives for themselves and their children.  We're talking about the young people here at this table. They're DREAMers in much more than name. They are kids that any parent would be proud of. I don't understand how anyone could look at these kids and think we should break up more families or turn away more hard workers with talent.  So I will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship for you and for families across our country. I will fight to stop partisan attacks on the executive actions that would put DREAMers--including many with us today--at risk of deportation.  And, if Congress refuses to act, as President I will do everything possible under the law to go even further. There are more people--like many parents of DREAMers and others with deep ties and contributions to our communities--who deserve a chance to stay. I'll fight for them too.  The law currently allows for sympathetic cases to be reviewed, but right now most of these cases have no way to get a real hearing. Therefore we should put in place a simple, straightforward, and accessible way for parents of DREAMers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities to make their case and be eligible for the same deferred action as their children.  But that's just the beginning. There's much more to do to expand and enhance protections for families and communities. To reform immigration enforcement and detention practices so they're more humane, more targeted, and more effective. And to keep building the pressure and support for comprehensive reform.  On a personal basis, the first time I ever met anyone who was in our country and working I was about 12 years old, as I recall, and through my church was recruited along with some of the other girls in my Sunday school class to serve as babysitters on Saturday for the small children so that the older children could join their parents in the fields. Because, believe it or not, when I was growing up in Chicago, it was farm fields as far as the eye can see. The immigrant workers would come up through Texas, up through the Midwest, up to Chicago, and then through Michigan, and we were asked to help out.  And I remember going out to the camp where the families lived and taking care of the little kids while kids my age were our doing really hard work.  And what stuck in my mind was how at the end of the day, there was a long road at the end of the camp that went out to a dirt road in the middle of the field.  And the bus that had the workers from the field on it that came back in around 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, stopped and let the workers off and all these little kids started running down that path to go see their parents and were scooped up by these really really tired people.  And I watched this and just thought, they're just like me and my brothers when my dad comes home from work and we go out there to see him when he comes back from his day of doing what he has to do to support us. I've never gotten that experience or that image out of my mind.  And so for me this is about what kind of people we all are and what kind of country we all have. I am absolutely convinced this is in our economic interest, in the interest of our values, and it's even in the interest of our long-term security as a nation.  So you know where I stand and there can be no question about it because I will do everything I can as President and during this campaign to make this case.  Now I know there are people who disagree with me, and I want them to have a conversation with me.  The facts are really clear, we know how much people who are working hard contribute to our economy both in what they buy and what they pay in taxes. In fact, in New York, which I know a little bit about because I represented it for eight years and I live there now, our undocumented workers in New York pay more in taxes that some of the biggest corporations in New York. So I'm ready to have this conversation with anyone anywhere.  And now let me turn to those who are living this story I want you to meet them and to talk with them.
